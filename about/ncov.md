## What is the Coronavirus?

The following is my summary of this pathogen. I highly encourage you to
read other sources as well. Wikipedia is a really underrated treasure
for science, bio, chem, and medical information. I will link sources as
they occur to me.

### What is a virus?

[Viruses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus) are infectious biological
particles that are _sort of_ alive. They, along with bacteria, fungus,
and parasites, are organisms responsible for causing disease. While all
of the other types of disease agents are living things, viruses are not
quite alive. Unlike living things, viruses do not eat, and they do not
'reproduce' the way other things do. Instead, viruses are like little
automated sabotage kits for your cells. They are made up of a set of
genetic instructions (either DNA or RNA), and proteins that let them
attach to, invade, and hijack your cells. While other living things
reproduce on their own, viruses make your body cells reproduce their
viruses.

### How do they do this?

The short answer is "[The Central Dogma of
Biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology)".
Every living cell has a "genetic code" made up of
[DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dna). DNA is a long chain of
molecules that come in four varieties: A (Adenine), G (Guanine), C
(Cytosine), T (Thymine). These four letters make up your genetic code,
which is very similar to computer code.

Different sections of DNA can be read off by special things in your
cells and used to make proteins. [Proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein)
are other biological molecules that make long chains. But while DNA exists only
to store information, proteins do things. In fact, every living thing is
made of proteins, and (almost) every biochemically interesting thing that happens
in your body, happens to, by, and because of proteins.

Viruses have DNA (or sometimes [RNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA),
which works similarily), but they don't have the tools to turn that DNA into
proteins. However, viruses are made of proteins, so where do they come from?
What a virus will do is use its proteins to get inside of a different cell. Once
inside, the virus spits out it's DNA into the cell, and it tricks the cell into
turning its DNA into proteins. The hijacked cell will make new copies
of the virus proteins, which combine to make new viruses. Eventually so
many new viruses are made that they explode out of the cell, killing the
cell.

### What are Coronaviruses?

[Coronaviruses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus) are a type of
virus. They are [enveloped
viruses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_envelope), which means that
they steal the skin of your cells for extra protection from your immune
system. They are [RNA
viruses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive-sense_single-stranded_RNA_virus),
which means that they use RNA instead of DNA for their genetic code.
They are called "Coronaviruses" from the Latin word "corona", which
means "crown". They are called this because, when looked at under an
electron microscope, their spike proteins (the things they use to attack
your cells) fan out around them like a crown.

There are many different kinds of coronaviruses. The most common ones
cause the common cold, while some others can be much more dangerous.
[SARS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome),
the disease that had an outbreak in 2003, and
[MERS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East_respiratory_syndrome),
an uncommon but extremely lethal disease from the middle east, are both
caused by coronaviruses

### What is this coronavirus?

Today, if someone talks about "the coronavirus", they likely mean the
new virus that was recognized as the cause of a [mysterious disease
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_outbreak) currently impacting the planet. It's official name is
[SARS-CoV-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2),
and the disease it causes is officially called
[COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019) (from
"Coronavirus Disease 2019") and colloquially called "Wuhan Flu", from
where it was first recognized.

SARS-CoV-2 is an extremely contagious, moderately lethal disease. We
still do not know much about it, and much of what we do know is
provisional and may turn out to be partially incorrect as we learn more.
It is spread primarily by coming into contact with the mucous membranes
of your respiratory tract. [It can do this in a few
ways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine\)):

* Droplet infection. When an infected person breathes out, coughs, or
  sneezes, the fluid in their breath can carry virus particles up to 2
  meters (6 feet). If these droplets come in contact with your eyes,
  nose, or mouth, you can become infected
* Aerosol infection. _**This is currently suspected but not decisively
  demonstrated**_. Aerosol infection happens when the viruses in the air
  can float significantly farther than 2 meters. This is much more
  dangerous, as it means that you can theoretically catch the disease just
  by breathing the same air as an infected person while being nearby.
* Fomite infection. A fomite is any object with virus particles on it.
  Coronavirus particles can live on objects for as long as a week. If
  you then touch an infected object, you get the virus particles on your
  skin. The virus cannot infect you through your skin, but if you touch
  your mouth, nose, or eyes with virus on your skin, it can get in that
  way
* Fecal-oral infection. Significant amounts of virus particles have been
  found in infected individuals' fecal matter. These virus particles can
  be spread in many ways. Flushing a toilet can cause clouds of virus
  particles to spread. Bad personal hygiene practices can get these
  virus particles onto your hands, where they can spread to anything you
  touch.

### What happens when I catch coronavirus?

The short answer is that we do not know. This is a completely new
disease, and we are learning about this disease as we go. All of the
information we have now is uncertain. In our rush to figure this out
quickly, scientists and doctors may make mistakes. Further, many
governments across the world are being very secretive, and may be lying
and hiding information in order to prevent mass panic. This is what we do know:

After you first get infected, there will be a period of time that can be
anywhere from 3 to 24 days (but will usually be 3-7 days) called the
'incubation period'. During this time, the virus is infecting your body,
but has not infected you enough for you to be sick yet. You will likely
not know that you are sick

About 3 days after you get infected, you _might_ become contagious to
others. This means that you might become contagious before you know you
are sick. Scientists and doctors have not been able to prove that people
are contagious before they are sick, but they worry that this might be
true and are trying to get more information. Officially, the WHO says
that there is no strong evidence of this happening, and most of the
cases where this has happened turned out to be people who were lying
about not being sick.

After the incubation phase, typically 5-10 days after getting infected,
you will get sick. The symptoms are very similar to the flu, at first.
You will get a fever and a dry cough. You may have some stomach issues,
but these are uncommon.

For about 80% of people, these flu symptoms will get worse for a week or
two, and then you will recover. You may continue to test positive for
the disease for a few weeks after you recover, but at this time I am not
aware of any evidence that you can "get sick again".

For about 20% of people, in the second week of being sick, you will need to
go to the hospital. For 3/4ths of the hospitalized people (about 13% of all
infected), you will have "severe" symptoms. This means that you will suffer
pneumonia and significant breathing difficulties. You will need oxygen
therapy, but, if you receive oxygen therapy, you will likely recover.

For about 1/4th of hospitalized people (about 4% of all infected), you
will progress to "critical" symptoms. People will critical symptoms will
require intensive hospital care for between 1 to 4 weeks.

Approximately 2% of people who get sick with COVID-19 will die.

### Who is most at risk?

Right now, it looks like elderly people, and people with existing health
problems, are at a much higher risk of dying of this disease than other
people. However, these statistics are uncertain and unreliable, and
nobody should think they are safe from getting very very sick.

From the WHO report, we know that the average death rate is 2%. We also
know that the average death rate for people under age 40 is only 0.2%
(ten times lower!). What we don't know is how many of those younger
people are severe cases. Does their lower death rate mean that they just
don't get as sick? Or do younger people need to be hospitalized just as
much, but they recover just as often? We just don't know.

### What's up with those social media videos?

There have been many videos leaked on social media, from China, from
Iran, and now one from New York, showing people collapsing in the middle
of the street. This is very scary. But at the moment, none of these
videos are confirmed. We don't know if they are real or not (I believe
they are real). We don't know if they are common, or if they have only
happened a handful of times. We don't know if these people are fainting,
or dying. We don't know if they get rescued by healthcare workers or if
they die. We don't know if they were already very sick, or if they
thought they were healthy. We don't know what is causing them to
collapse.

At the moment, all we can do is wait and see

### Does everyone who catches Coronavirus get sick?

We really don't know. This is a situation that is changing quickly, and
we are trying to learn more.

There has been a lot of questions about how many 'mild, undetected'
cases there are. That is, how many people get infected and either never
get sick, or don't get sick enough to realize that they have
coronavirus. This is very important to figure out. When we say that "20%
of people who get infected will need to be hospitalized", we don't
really have a way of knowing how many people are infected, unless we
test every single person. In reality, we only test people who come to
the hospital, and people only come to the hospital once they are are
already sick. It could be that for every person who goes to the
hospital, there are 500 people who got infected but didn't get sick. It
could also be that for every person who goes to the hospital, there are
zero people who got infected but didn't get sick. The fact is that we
just don't know.

Right now, there are three sources of data that I personally think can
shed some light on this:

* The WHO report. The WHO report says that they believe that there is no
  evidence of large numbers of asymptomatic cases. In other words:
  _everybody_ who gets infected gets sick.
* The Diamond Princess. This was a cruise ship that was quarantined for
  two weeks off the coast of Japan. Hundreds of people on board got
  sick. If you assume that everybody on board got infected, then it
  looks like, for every person who got sick, there were 2 or 3 people
  who got infected but did not get sick
* The Shincheonji church in Korea. This was a church that is the
  epicenter of infection in Korea. Korean authorities have
  blanket-tested every member of this church. Of the people showing
  signs of illness, 80% had positive tests. Of the people _NOT_ showing
  signs of illness, 70% had positive tests. If we assume the tests are
  accurate (note: likely not a safe assumption), and we do the relevant
  math, it suggests that for every person who gets sick, there is one
  person who doesn't get sick

### Is Asymptomatic Infection good or bad?

This is a good question. If we find out that for every infected sick
person, there are five infected not-sick people, is this good or bad?
Well, it's both, and it depends on your perspective.

If it turns out that everybody who gets infected gets sick, then in one
sense that could be very bad. It means that those hospitalization
numbers are true, and if true, that is very, very, very bad. But it also
means that this isn't quite as contagious as we expect. It also means
that we can find _everybody_ who is sick, at least eventually

On the other hand, if it turns out that for every person who gets sick,
there are lots of people who don't get sick, it means that this is much
much more contagious than we expect, and we have no hope of stopping it.
But it also means it's much much less dangerous than we expect.

### What should I expect? What should I do?

I'm not going to bullshit you. I think that this is going to be bad. I
think this is going to be the worst crisis in the history of the United
States. I am very, very scared. But all we can do is prepare, hope for
the best, expect the worst.

I believe that the hospitalization rate is broadly accurate, and I
believe that this disease will not be contained. This is going to be
very, very bad. It means that we will get to a point where there are
hospital beds (for example) for 10 people, but 50 people need them.

As a society, the best thing we can do is to slow down the spread of
this disease as much as possible. The survival rate of this disease
increases dramatically with proper medical care. If everybody is going
to get infected, eventually, then the longer we can drag the disease
out, the fewer people will be sick at the same time, and the more people
will be able to get proper healthcare.

How do we do this? Follow the CDC/WHO public health guidelines, mostly.
Engage in "social distancing"; stop going out in public, stop going to
crowded events. Work from home, if you can. Stock up on groceries and
supplies, so you don't have to go to the grocery store as often.
Practice meticulous hygiene. Avoid public restrooms if possible. Wash
your hands often. Use hand sanitizers. Do not touch your face. Wear
masks in public (but be smart about it. We have a massive mask shortage
and it's important to save them for the most important uses. If you only
have 10 masks you don't want to use them up before the outbreak hits
your city).

Avoid hospitals as much as you can. A large percentage of infections in
China were reported as hospital-acquired infections. The last thing you
want to do is to go to your doctor's office to get a prescription filled
and get infected while you are there.

_**IF YOU ARE SICK, STAY HOME AND SELF-ISOLATE**_. Even if you think
it's just a cold, or just the flu, better safe than sorry. Do not go out
in public when you are sick. Do not risk infecting other people. Our
leaders aren't going to give the inspirational speech, so I will: it is
your duty to the human race to make personal sacrifices to help contain
this. Do your duty.

If you are sick, do not go to the hospital right away. Phone them first.
You do not want to risk infecting everyone else there. Be warned: there
is a lot of chaos around this right now, and many hospitals and health
authorities don't seem to know what they are doing. You may phone them
and they may tell you something stupid. They might play hot potato with
your call, passing you between different people who have no answers.
That sucks, but it is what it is.

If you are _very_ sick, that is the time to call hospital emergency
services. If you are having serious trouble breathing, or have other
pneumonia symptoms, then that is the time when you need to be
hospitalized.

Do not be afraid of the cost of medical care (This is not
legal/financial advice). I believe it is highly likely that this
pandemic will be so bad that the government will be forced to implement
some kind of blanket medical debt forgiveness. Even if they don't,
medical debt collections is a problem for next year, and we need to make
it through this year first. This might destroy your credit rating.
Better to destroy your credit rating than destroy your life. Better to
destroy your credit rating than to destroy all of our lives.

Do not politicize this issue, and do not make this a partisan issue. Do
not fight over this. Do not throw blame to whichever politician you
dislike. The fact is that our emergency services, our civil service, our
bureaucracy, were there before our current president and will be there
after he's gone. They were there before our last president and stayed
there after he was gone. They are the ones responsible for the
horrendous failure that has been our society's response to this issue.
This outbreak is not Trump's fault. This outbreak is not Obama's fault.
It is not the Democrats' fault. It is not the Republicans' fault. It is
simply a crisis, a crisis we need to solve, and we won't solve it by
pointing fingers and fighting. Very importantly: do not make jokes about
intentionally spreading this disease, as that one official did about a
political rally the other day. This is a very serious situation. Jokes
like that can spread confusion, destroy trust, and will make it that
much harder for us to come together and fix this. There will be plenty
of time to joke about Republicans or Democrats dying after this crisis
is over. Put it on pause for now.


### What is next?

I believe that, within the next month or two, we will start to see
widespread lockdowns and quarantines like they did in China. This will
be horrendously disruptive to our daily lives, and to our society.
Things will break down. Your daily life will be disrupted.

You may be stuck in your home, without being able to go outside, for
long periods of time. Prioritize whatever you need to do to maintain
your emotional health. Stock up on some good books to read.

Avoid making any travel plans or event plans. I expect widespread travel
shutdowns in the near future. It's much better to just put those plans
on pause, rather than worrying about having thousands of dollars of
flights cancelled with no refunds.

Prepare for an emergency. I will write a more in-depth guide for this at
a later time. For now, the important parts are: have food, water,
medication, sanitation, and hygiene supplies on hand. Keep your vehicle
gassed up, and consider storing some extra gasoline, just in case. Have
the means to protect yourself in case of crime, looters, or riots, and
be prepared to use those means. Talk to your friends about this, lay out
explicit emergency plans, involving what needs to happen to put your
plans into action, where you all will meet up, what you all will do, and
what you expect to happen.

Cooperate with authorities. If a doctor tells you to quarantine at home,
quarantine at home. If you lose your job, you lose your job. There are
always going to be more jobs out there, but you only have one life, and
we only have one society. If emergency services tell you not to go
somewhere, don't go there. Quarantines are there for a reason.

Do whatever you need to do to emotionally prepare for all of this.
Society _will_ be severely disrupted. People you know _will_ die. Better
to figure out ways to cope with this _now_, than to react in a panic
when it happens.

Be prepared to step up. Our leaders and authorities are failing us
miserably, and we are entering a period of time in the near future where
everyday heroes will be the difference between life and death. Don't
wait for permission to act; if you know what needs to be done, do it. If
nobody else is there coordinating, telling people what to do, then step
up and tell them yourself. If you have special skills that will help,
use them. When this is all over, we will have to return to normalcy. Be
prepared to help with that work.

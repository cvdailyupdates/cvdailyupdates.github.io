## Welcome

Hello,

A month and a half ago, I started seeing strange things pop up on 4chan and
Discord. Rumours of an epidemic centered in Wuhan, China. Leaked social media
videos of horrible things. Chinese-language posts that allegedly (I don't
speak Chinese) were begging for help.

For a week it was a dumb joke, like any other internet conspiracy theory. But
a week later, the rumours didn't stop.

On January 23rd, 2020, the city of Wuhan was put under lockdown. It was at this
moment that I realized this was more than just an internet conspiracy theory.

Of the people I spoke to online about this, many didn't seem to grasp the
severity of the situation. As the Bartlett quote goes: "The greatest shortcoming
of the human race is our inability to understand the exponential function". But I
knew what I was seeing. Something so bad that the government of China was willing
to put a major city on pause for six weeks (at the time of this writing) and counting.

Since then, I've been in a state of near constant panic, reading as many
daily updates as I can find. There's a lot of them, and it's very
difficult to tell what is real, what is fake, what is mistaken, what is
inaccurate, and what is outright lies. But every day I spend hours
filtering through these sources so I can feel ok.

A friend requested that I give him concise daily summaries so he didn't
have to sift through the noise. Another friend asked me to put this
somewhere online so he could link to it. So here we are.

An important note: _**I DO NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATION THAT EVERYTHING
POSTED HERE IS TRUE**_. Some of what I post may not be true. I am
sifting through rumours and theories so you don't have to, and I'm not a
mind reader. But I promise you, everything I post here, I personally
believe to be true, unless I say otherwise.

Do not take my postings as definitive truth and fact. Read everything,
this site included, with a critical mind. In this era of fake news it is
nearly impossible to have confidence that any given thing is true or
not. All we can do is check it by our common sense and decide for
ourselves what we think. I think that in the comings weeks and months we
are going to see the worst crisis in my life. I want to do my part,
however small, to help.

I will likely make generalizations, estimate math, round numbers, and so
on. I do not intend to mislead or misreport. If you see anything in my
updates that you think is wrong, please contact me and I will correct
it.

I will post links to potential medical treatments. I will avoid posting
anything I think is obviously false, and I will avoid posting anything
that I think is dangerous. However, I will post things that I think show
promise and I will post things that I think are low-risk and worth
trying even if they don't work. _**NOTHING ON THIS SITE IS MEDICAL
ADVICE. I AM NOT A DOCTOR, NOT A BIOLOGIST, NOT A CHEMIST. YOU AND YOU
ALONE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DECIDING TO TRY ANY MEDICAL INTERVENTIONS I
POST HERE**_. Some of these posts might be called fake or untrue by
other sources. It is up to you what you want to believe, on a
case-by-case basis.

I will try my best to be fair, balanced, and neutral, to report the
facts as I see them and avoid politics or bias. But this site is my
opinion and at times I will be opinionated

I will not monetize this site in any way, and I will not attach any
marketing, tracking, advertising, etc. This website is open source and

Copyright: I hereby grant blanket permission for anyone to copy any part
of my daily updates, as long as they credit the site.

Inquiries: cvdailyupdates at protonmail dot com. I can't promise I will
check this regularly, and I can't promise I will reply to everyone, but
I will do my best.

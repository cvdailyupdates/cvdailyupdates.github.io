### Special Feature

So something has been bothering me for a while and I would really like
an answer to it. The Chinese data shows that the fatality rate for
people under 40 is much, much lower than everyone else, and other data
sources _generally_ match this. But fatality isn't the only thing going
on here. How does younger peoples' rate of severity scale? Does this
imply that they also get more milder diseases? Or do they get diseases
just as severe but they live through it more frequently?

Singapore is (allegedly) doing a very good job with containment and
tracking, and has [a website](https://co.vid19.sg/dashboard) up. As far
as I know, this website tracks literally every coronavirus patient in
Singapore. I looked through some of their data.

Of the people currently hospitalized, 15% are age 18-30 and 26% are age 31-45

Of the people who have recovered, the average stay in hospital for age 18-30 is 10.7 days and the average stay in hospital for people who are 31-45 is 10.9 days

There are 115 total infected between ages 20 and 50 in Singapore. Of those, 44 are currently hospitalized.

There are 90 total infected over age 50. Of those, 62 are currently hospitalized

There is no easy way on the site that I've figured out to include people who were previously hospitalized and then released

Now, small sample size, all sorts of confounds that could come into play
here, but two things worth calling out. The first is that their
hospitalization rate is _**dramatically**_ higher than the
mild/severe/critical data would suggest. What does this mean? I suspect
it means that the threshold for hospitalization in Singapore is lower,
and that milder cases are being hospitalized. Maybe they use hospital
rooms as quarantine zones for positive patients.

The second thing I notice is that, while the risk of hospitalizeable
illness is significantly lower for younger people than for older people,
that's still 38% of infected younger people currently hospitalized. Ten
days in hospital sounds pretty fuckin' serious. And again, I don't have
an easy way of getting a count of all people who were _ever_
hospitalized, so for all I know their hosptialization rates are the same
but young people recover while old people die.

More data is needed but I'm considering this significant evidence in the
"even young people are fucked" direction. I am scared.

### Sites/Links

* [This is an interesting medium
  post](https://medium.com/@svscarpino/covid-19-keep-calm-and-wash-your-hands-d26993196c0aZ)
  that puts things in perspective. I'm not sure I agree with its
  relatively rosy perspective but it was still interesting

### Asia

* [Music clubs emerge as coronavirus transmission
  sites](https://de.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-japan-music/update-2-japans-live-music-clubs-emerge-as-new-coronavirus-transmission-sites-idINL4N2B32CF)
  in Osaka. I have about $150 worth of wasted EDM tickets for shows I
  bailed out on over Coronavirus and I'm glad I did

### Europe

* More places are going into lockdown now. It's getting tiresome to keep
  track of them all.
* Sent in by a reader: [Spains death rate is anomalously
  high](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusDACH/comments/fi4y6s/stand_20200313_grafische_aufbereitung_der/).
  Run Google Translate on the page and then look at the graph entitled
  "Relative number of deaths". No explanation for this at this time.
* The UK's plan continues to be "[infect 'em all, let God sort'em
  out](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/britain-takes-different-approach-coronavirus-outbreak-leaving-some-asking-why-n1157831)". I am very, very worried that this will backfire horrendously. UK readers, take responsibility for your own well-being.

### US

* Sent in from a reader: Trump apparently executive-actioned away a
  bunch of rules and regs that would slow things down. Private companies
  are actually picking up the testing slack (I'm skeptical but we shall
  see). And the markets seemed to respond positively to this?
* [US Extends europe travel
  restrictions](https://twitter.com/disclosetv/status/1238868933278674944)
  to UK and Ireland. That was fast
* [Trump considering domestic travel restrictions](https://twitter.com/trtworldnow/status/1238869506820276225?s=21).
  I think we're one, maybe two weeks away from these. If you're going to
  risk any travel right now, I hope you like where you're going, because
  you may be stuck there indefinitely
* [Washington state at stage
  11](https://twitter.com/ByMikeBaker/status/1238485594877001741) of
  it's 13-stage pandemic response plan. Stage 12 is don't-leave-your-house
  lockdown. Stage 13 is "nobody leaves this city". Washington readers,
  prepare for the worst. Everyone else, prepare for the worst like a
  week after WA
* [First confirmed case of
  COVID-19](https://twitter.com/disclosetv/status/1238882750125477888?s=09)
  in a prison employee. We've seen how this plays out elsewhere.
  Eventually they'll be forced to either release the prisoners or make
  them all sick and die. If they choose the first option, I hope
  Delaware County exercises their right to keep and bear arms. If they
  choose the second, well, that's pretty horrifying, but at least it
  functions as a sort of experiment.

### Canada

* [Covid Canada](http://www.covidcanada.ca/) looks like a decent
  resource for tracking things.

### Science/Medical

* [People who recover from the virus have permanently compromized lung
  function?](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-recovery-damage-lung-function-gasping-air-hong-kong-doctors-2020-3).
  At least some of them do. It seems to me, based on the news article,
  that it's probably the people who recovered from more severe cases who
  have these problems
* [Wuhan lockdown seems to have
  worked](https://twitter.com/AdamJKucharski/status/1238152492178976769),
  but this guy crunched the numbers and there's a problem: as soon as they
  lift it, they're getting more outbreaks
* I am not a doctor, but [some food for
  thought](https://twitter.com/startupdaemon/status/1238840667419414529).
  I'm pretty sure wearing masks in public would dramatically help, and
  the "masks don't really work" propaganda is mostly because the
  authorities think we are too stupid and selfish to accept "look we have
  massive shortages and healthcare workers need to be prioritized"
* Dutch researchers say they've identified [an antibody that can be
  used](https://nos.nl/artikel/2327076-wetenschappers-rotterdam-en-utrecht-claimen-vondst-antilichaam-tegen-corona.html)
  against this disease. Good news, both directly, and because it
  presumably helps with progress towards a vaccine
* [Over half of Dutch critical patients are under age
  50](https://twitter.com/disclosetv/status/1238952826233118728?s=09).
  Now there's a lot of confounders that could apply here, but this is
  unnerving.

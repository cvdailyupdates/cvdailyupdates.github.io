### 2020.03.06

### Official Numbers:

* [The total number of confirmed infected has exceeded 100,000
  worldwide](https://twitter.com/bnodesk/status/1235886017674125314?s=21).
  Remember, doubling period is approximately a week. By the first week
  of April we'll have 1M _official_ infections. Now keep in mind that the
  official numbers are off by a factor of 10 at least

### Website and Links:

* Site now has an RSS feed. I have no idea if it works right or not

### Middle East:

* [Somebody's personal
  story](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/febz3f/my_experience_of_living_in_a_city_without/)
  about Tehran. He claims it is not as bad as I have been lead to believe

### China:

* Nothing to report

### Asia:

* [Korea has tested 140,000
  people](https://www.yahoo.com/news/south-korea-tested-140-000-031000719.html).
  They're reporting a current death rate of 0.6%. Does this mean that
  there is a massive long tail of mild/asymptomatic infection? I think
  it's too soon to tell, but we can hope

### Europe:

* Nothing to report

### UK:

* NHS considering [drafting med
  students](https://www.hsj.co.uk/acute-care/medical-students-and-new-doctors-could-be-drafted-in-to-fight-coronavirus/7027060.article)
  to augment medical workforce. This is sufficiently serious that I
  won't share my usual opinion on the subject of socialized medicine.

### US:

* [Healthcare Information and Management Systems
  Society](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/tech/himss-cancels-2020-global-health-conference-due-to-coronavirus)
  global health conference cancelled
* [FBI employee at SF field
  office](https://twitter.com/ShimonPro/status/1236111888095883264?s=19)
  confirmed infected
* [NYC formally telling people to get prepping](https://twitter.com/Laurie_Garrett/status/1236120103185510401?s=20)
* [SXSW FINALLY
  CANCELLED](https://twitter.com/bnodesk/status/1236049922706886658?s=21).
  I get to live! No hipsters spreading plague to every corner of my city
* [Diamond Princess 2: Electric
  Boogaloo](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/dozens-of-passengers-on-a-stranded-cruise-ship-are-infected-by-coronavirus-that-number-could-soon-grow/2020/03/06/17cf1974-5fdb-11ea-b014-4fafa866bb81_story.html).
  almost half the people tested are infected. Pence committed today to
  testing every single person on board. This will provide interesting data
  if nothing else.
* [Emerald City Comic Con
  postponed](https://www.kuow.org/stories/emerald-city-comic-con-is-canceled-for-2020)
* [San Mateo County Health Officer gives
  statement](https://www.smchealth.org/coronavirus). This statement is a
  perfect example of what I wish we could get from all our leaders.
  Instead, our politicians dick around, the WHO bitches about racism, the
  CDC tells us to wash our hands and pray for the best. Clown world.
* [A bunch of people who went to PAX
  East](https://twitter.com/AndrewQuackson/status/1236041334521311237)
  got pneumonia. I've heard of con flu but 20-somethings getting
  pneumonia?


### Canada:
* [Coronavirus reported in Toronto patient who returned from Las
  Vegas](https://news3lv.com/news/local/coronavirus-reported-in-canadian-patient-with-las-vegas-travel-history).
  Very strange, I wonder which direction the causality goes. This seems
  to suggest the disease is already everywhere which, if true, is good
  news (as it couldn't be as lethal as expected, and also be everywhere,
  without us knowing)

### Tech:

* [Two Microsoft
  employees](https://twitter.com/KYWeise/status/1235799066279178242)
  confirmed infected

### Science/Medical:

* [German researchers identify
  protease](https://www.rnd.de/gesundheit/coronavirus-mogliches-medikament-von-forschern-identifiziert-FZXKQDXB2ZAGXHQR7U3LBKFNOM.html)
  that seems to prevent coronavirus infections
* [Story of Australian couple who got
  infected](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-05/coronavirus-covid-19-what-its-like-to-have-the-virus/12026902)
  on a cruise. Two interesting things. First, woman is testing positive
  again after recovery. Second: the man tested positive but never showed
  symptoms. Overall I think this is good news
* [Preliminary safety trials for vaccine
  candidate](https://www.livescience.com/us-coronavirus-vaccine-trial-recruiting.html).
  Good news, but do not be fooled: the BEST case is that we're one year
  out on a vaccine
* [Some virologists
  demanding](http://virological.org/t/response-to-on-the-origin-and-continuing-evolution-of-sars-cov-2/418)
  that the "S-type and L-type" paper be retracted

### Market:

* [Lufthansa cuts 150 planes' worth of
  capacity](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lufthansa-coronavirus-exclusive-idUSKBN20R229).
  I've seen reports of other airlines doing similar

### Updates

Special feature update today.

[Sources believe coronavirus originated in Wuhan lab as part of China's
efforts to compete with US](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/coronavirus-wuhan-lab-china-compete-us-sources)

Everyone who was paying attention to the scuttlebutt online in Jan/Feb
knew this was true. I have believed it to be true for months. And we
were all called conspiracy theorists for it. We've now got the
turnaround time from "conspiracy theory" to "official truth" down to
only two months.

More seriously: it is extremely telling that the media establishment is
openly saying this. It marks a dramatic shift in public consensus.
Perhaps things will get interesting?

### Updates

* Kentucky police have been jotting down the license plate numbers of
  cars that went to churches for easter, and are going around to every
  single person's house to slap down a 14 day quarantine order. This is
  insane, and if they pull shit like this for more than a few days there
  are going to be a lot of freedom seeds getting planted
* [China is banning research into the origin of this
  virus](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/12/asia/china-coronavirus-research-restrictions-intl-hnk).
  This is by far the clearest evidence to me that it is a lab containment
  breach
* [MMR vaccine protects against coronavirus,
  apparently](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.10.20053207v1)

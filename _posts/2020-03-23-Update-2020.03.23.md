### Updates

Today was a slow news day, apparently, and I don't have enough updates
to justify splitting them out into categories

* [Mayor of Bergamo
  says](https://www.tgcom24.mediaset.it/cronaca/lombardia/coronavirus-giorgio-gori-a-bergamo-ospedali-pieni-gente-muore-in-casa-e-senza-fare-tampone_16449986-202002a.shtml)
  that for every coronavirus death, there are three 'unidentified viral
  pneumonia' deaths. To rephrase: Mayor of Bergamo says that real death
  stats are 4x the reported death stats
* My city [goes into lockdown tomorrow](https://www.statesman.com/news/20200323/coronavirus-shelter-in-place-order-will-be-issued-tuesday-for-travis-williamson-counties). Having just recovered from what I'm pretty sure was mild coronavirus, which presumably makes me both immune and not a transmission risk anymore, I suddenly feel very strongly that this is an egregious violation of my first amendment rights.
* Washington State is [still lacking test
  kits](https://komonews.com/news/coronavirus/positive-tests-dont-reflect-true-scale-of-outbreak-in-wash-says-top-doctor).
  I thought the federal government said they made 10,000,000 available?
  Weird, that, it's almost as if they lied
* I swear to fuck I'm not making this up: [Loss of your sense of smell is
  a symptom of
COVID-19](https://twitter.com/davidasinclair/status/1242135905579778049),
  because it fucks with the "sonic hedgehog protein". There Was An
  Extinction Level Event In 2012 And We All Live In A Simulation. There
  is no other explanation

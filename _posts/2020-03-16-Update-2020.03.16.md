### 2020.03.16

I was lazy today and didn't do a proper roundup of links and data.
Therefore, today's update consists of the following:

* [San Francisco Bay Area mandates full
  lockdown](https://www.sfdph.org/dph/alerts/files/HealthOrderC19-07-%20Shelter-in-Place.pdf).
  It's happening. It will happen where you live soon enough
* England giving up on their 'herd immunity' insanity. They claim they
  found new data suggesting young people are also at risk, which brings
  them up to what we knew a month ago. I lost the link for this. 
* RETRACTION: One of the threads I linked to recently was [most likely
  not accurate](https://twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom/status/1239348331186249728).
* IMPORTANT NEWS: [Anti-inflammatory
  medications](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuWo5lmWuZI) likely make
  COVID-19 worse.
* A [whole town in
  Italy](https://www.repubblica.it/salute/medicina-e-ricerca/2020/03/16/news/coronavirus_studio_il_50-75_dei_casi_a_vo_sono_asintomatici_e_molto_contagiosi-251474302/?ref=RHPPTP-BH-I251454518-C12-P3-S2.4-T1)
  got tested. 50-75% of people were asymptomatic-positive. Good news in
  that the death rate is likely half of what we thought. Bad news in that
  infection risk is much much much higher

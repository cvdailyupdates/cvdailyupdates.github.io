### Updates

Two housekeeping updates

1) I just realized that for the past few days, I have been updating the
deltas on numbers but not, it seems, the raw counts. This is entirely an
error on my part. Consequently, I am resetting all my counts in light of
some site changes (see below). I am not posting numbers today

2) Over the past few weeks I have lost most of my interest in following
this pandemic. It has not developed to be the crisis I thought it would
be. Things aren't happening as frequently, presumably because all of
society is on pause now. We (or at least I) have a general understanding
of the biology of this disease and the marginal value of each new study
is not as high. Meanwhile, most of my sources of information have been
fully converged by the authorities, and have started reporting
narratives instead of facts. This makes it harder for me to find things
worth reporting

All of this comes together to say that _**I will no longer be doing
daily updates**_. I don't want to shut this site down, and I don't want
to feel like my passion project is a massive failure, so instead of
stopping entirely, this website is getting rebranded. We are now
Coronavirus Weekly Updates. I will start providing updates on a weekly
cadence, and if in the next few weeks my heart is still not in it, I
will retire this site.

### Updates

* [ACE2 variants underlie interindividual variability and susceptibility
  to COVID-19 in Italian
  population](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.20047977v1).
  They used Italian population genetic data to find genes predictive of
  lower ACE2 levels, and this seems to correlate with less disease
* [Interesting take on the appropriate public health
  measures](https://twitter.com/lymanstoneky/status/1247161207984775170).
  I'm not sure that I'm as optimistic as he is regarding "give people info
  and they'll do the right thing" but I'm 100% on board with his
  accusation that our authorities have done very very bad job on the
  'clear understadnable actionable information' front
* [Austria wants to slowly relax public health measures starting April
  14th](https://twitter.com/disclosetv/status/1247094857962860549?s=21).
  An Austrian friend has been telling me about the measures there and they
  seem to have their shit together? Strict early lockdown arrested the
  spread, now they want to go back to normal. From what he says, it
  sounds like they actually did contain it, but the problem is that once
  they start relaxing measures they will just re-import it from the rest
  of Europe
* Meanwhile, in Singapore, they're [suspending Terminal 2 of Changi
  Airport for 18
  months](https://twitter.com/disclosetv/status/1247094399097614336?s=21).
* Over the past 48ish hours: [Boris Johnson admitted to
  hospital](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-britain/uk-pm-johnson-in-hospital-with-persistent-covid-19-symptoms-but-still-working-idUSKBN21O0DQ)
  but he's totally fine. Followed, like 12 hours later, with him being
  admitted to the ICU. Latest development: He's stable, [receiving oxygen
  therapy](https://twitter.com/disclosetv/status/1247494984238055424?s=09),
  but not on a ventilator (yet???).
* Another guy maintaining a website doing [broadly the same thing I do
  here](https://swprs.org/a-swiss-doctor-on-covid-19/). Unfortunately
  I'm not sure how I feel about a website called "Swiss Propaganda
  Research" but I judge it on its content and so far it seems legit

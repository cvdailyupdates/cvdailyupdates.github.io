* Someone emailed in to tell me that the before and after photos of the
  Port of Seattle are fake news. Real photos, but not from the current
  situation. Consider this a retraction of that update

### Middle East:

* Deep dive into what [the real numbers in Iran probably
  are](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/irans-coronavirus-problem-lot-worse-it-seems/607663/). It is worth keeping in mind that there is no reason in principle why other nations wouldn't be keeping just as many cases under wraps. Things start looking a lot different if you hypothesize that China has had a million infections by now

### Europe:

  house](https://www.bild.de/wa/ll/bild-de/unangemeldet-42925516.bild.html).
  Italian authorities will not test him, and will not remove the body

  hits in force

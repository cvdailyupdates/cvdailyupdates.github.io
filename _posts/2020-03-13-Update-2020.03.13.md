### Website Updates

I've noticed that there is something of a slowdown in reportable news
lately. I browse through the reddits and there's not a whole lot of new
things coming up. It's like too many things are happening so they only
report the headline things. Consequently, I'm getting the feeling that
updates will be getting a little bit lighter in the near future. Don't
worry, I'm still posting my updates. It's just that I might have fewer
things to post.

I also might get lazier about posting sources. A lot of what I come
across is in Discord servers where I can't easily post the source. I
generally don't post any of this unless I can find an external link to
confirm it. I may start posting these as commentary updates, instead.

If any of you want to help me crowdsource more updates, you can
contribute by email, you can contribute by github, and you can tag or
message /u/cvdailyupdates on reddit. I will credit you in whichever way
you wish.

### Europe

* [Italy reports 250 deaths in one
  day](https://www.news18.com/news/world/italy-hits-one-day-record-with-250-new-coronavirus-deaths-2536489.html).
  Don't forget that the _best_ case scenario is that many deaths, every
  day, for months. The worst case scenario is exponential growth

* The UK has an insane plan: [get as many young healthy people infected
  as fast as they possibly
  can](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus-herd-immunity-uk-covid-19-pandemic-outbreak-flu-a9400171.html?utm_source=reddit.com),
  subject to medical resource availability, to develop society-wide herd
  immunity. I think this is an extremely bad idea, because young people
  are not nearly as resiliant to this plague as the UK appears to think
  they are

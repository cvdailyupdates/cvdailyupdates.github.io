### Updates

* My city just passed a new lockdown order. It is now a crime punishable
  by 180 days in jail for any adult to be outside of their homes without
  a mask for any reason. The only exceptions are 1) if you're currently in
  the act of eating food; or 2) if you are exercising somewhere where
  there are no other people. If you get caught hiking on a trail and
  passing someone while not wearing a mask? JAIL. Now, I'm certain this
  will actually be enforced less than 5 times, ever. But, honest to
  fuck, the actual law in my city right now is "it is _a crime_ to leave
  your house without a mask". You know, the same masks they said two weeks
  ago don't work. So much for due process, eh? As of this moment I am
  officially more concerned about the erosion of my civil rights than I am
  the erosion of my public health, and I intend to proceed accordingly
* NOT MEDICAL ADVICE: [chronic marijuana usage appears to be protective
  towards
  COVID-19](https://twitter.com/toad_spotted/status/1249741452403519493).
  For the first time, the marijuana actually _is_ medicinal. Mechanism, if
  I understand it, is that cannabis suppresses IL-6. IL-6 levels get
  elevated by infection and this triggers cytokine storm
* ALSO NOT MEDICAL ADVICE: [The
  same](https://mobile.twitter.com/kerpen/status/1249726952602296320) seems
  to be true of cigarette smokers, against all reason. Only 1.3% of severe
  patients in the US are current smokers, and 2.3% are
  former smokers. Consider that the background rate of smoking in the US
  is about 15%, and that's _dramatically_ under-represented. Who knows
  why.

* [One of the largest pork-processing plants in the country is closing
  indefinitely](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/12/business/meat-plant-closures-smithfield/index.html).
  Food supply chain starting to look mighty fragile
* Speaking of food supply chain fragility, [Michigan just made it
  illegal to buy gardening
  equipment](https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2020/04/10/whitmer-stay-home-michigan-lottery/5129316002/).
  As in, you can go to the grocery store to buy groceries, but if you want
  to pick up some vegetable seeds, you know, to grow your own food WHEN
  THE FOOD SUPPLY BREAKS, that's illegal. Those sections of store are
  blocked off with caution tape. It's "non-essential", you see. Meanwhile,
  lottery tickets are still considered essential. Odd, that.
* It's definitely not a lab accident: [China bans research into origin
  of
  coronavirus](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/china-restricts-publication-of-coronavirus-research).
  Because you definitely ban nosy people asking difficult questions when
  you have nothing to hide. Definitely.

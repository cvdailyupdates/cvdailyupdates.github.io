### USA

* [First known (to me anyway) US politician dies of
  Coronavirus](https://www.wxyz.com/news/state-rep-isaac-robinson-has-died-sources-say)
* The case map for my city now breaks things out by zip code, instead of
  city district. My zip code is tied for most-infected with 14
  confirmed. That's ok I still didn't want to go outside anyway


### Science/Medical

* I don't really speak doctor, but if you want to build your own
  antibody test in your garage, [I think this paper tells you how to do
  it](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037713v1)
* [Estimating how much of the spread is
  undocumented](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/03/24/science.abb3221.abstract)
* These researchers are asking permission to do [live virus challenge
  testing](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/42639016/How%20to%20accelerate%20Coronavirus%20vaccine%20testing_020.pdf)
  to volunteers. That is, prove the vaccine works by getting a bunch of
  volunteers, giving half the vaccine and half a placebo, _**and then
  infecting them all with coronavirus**_. They say the situation is dire,
  and if people want to be heroes and risk their livers to save us all,
  let them!
* Apparently [TB
  vaccine](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042937v1)
  has a significant protective effect on COVID-19
* In addition to being a respiratory virus and a cardiovascular virus,
  [the coronavirus is also a neurological
virus](https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/lost-smell-and-taste-hint-covid-19-can-target-the-nervous-system-67312)
* More research claiming that [warm, windy, humid areas have lower
  infection
  risk](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.27.20045658v1)
* ["Hospital in Belgium decides to start testing ALL patients for corona whether they have symptoms or not, whether they are there for unrelated reasons. Results: "first results show that five out of fifty patients - or about 10 percent - are infected without showing any symptoms.""](https://twitter.com/BaldingsWorld/status/1244631577658658816)
* [Inexplicably, smoking might actually make you _safer_ from
  coronavirus](https://mobile.twitter.com/KlausKblog/status/1242995506118307840?s=19).
  THIS IS NOT MEDICAL ADVICE.

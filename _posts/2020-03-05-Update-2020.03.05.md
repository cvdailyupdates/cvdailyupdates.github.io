### 2020.03.05

underestimates

### Website and Links:

* If you think there are any errors on this site, open a pull request to
  correct it. If you think there is any content I should include, please
  open an issue. You can do both of these things at [the Github
repo](https://github.com/cvdailyupdates/cvdailyupdates.github.io)
* I don't want to add any Javascript to this site, but it would be nice
  if I could make these sections collapsible. There is a `<details>`
  HTML5 tag that would work, but I can't figure out how to make it play
  nice with Jekyll. If anyone knows how to do this, please contact me
* I have update the title of this website to "daily(ish) updates" to
  reflect that I'm a guy with other things to do and can't commit to
  publishing updates 100% for sure at the same time every day. In general,
  I will push updates to the daily page throughout the day, and if you
  can guess the URL you can read them early. Otherwise, I will publish
  daily updates to the front page at some undetermined time in the evening

### Middle East:

* ["We're estimating 30 to 40 percent of Tehran's population will be infected with COVID-19 by March 20,"](https://twitter.com/HeshmatAlavi/status/1235496800112586753). HOLY HELL. Tehran: 12 million people. 30%: 3.6M people. 720,000 people in severe or critical state, needing immediate medical care. 70,000 deaths. _**IN THREE WEEKS**_
* [Iran to close all
  schools](https://twitter.com/bnodesk/status/1235514853370052610?s=21)
  for a month
* [First confirmed case in Saudi
  Arabia](https://flutrackers.com/forum/forum/middle-east/saudi-arabia-ab/833053-saudi-arabia-announces-first-case-of-coronavirus)
* Israel to [cordon off
  Bethlehem](https://twitter.com/BNODesk/status/1235659957133074432?s=20)
* [Person on Twitter](https://twitter.com/AcidFastBacilli/status/1235575541564137475) (~~location unknown, presumably Washington state~~ in Iran) with dire warnings about the state of preparedness of our hospitals. "icu got overcrowded in less than 2 days. now staff are getting ill too". Shit's getting real, real fast

### China:

* A patient who was discharged as recovered [has
  died](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3065091/coronavirus-recovered-patient-dies-china-reports-139-new-cases).
  This may be evidence that reinfection is occurring, however I still
  believe it's inconsistent testing. There are rumours that China is
  discharging patients who have not yet fully recovered, in order to make
  numbers look better. If, as the one recent article said, 14% of
  'recovered' patients are getting sick again, I'd expect a lot more than
  _one_ death

### Asia:

* Thailand to [start disinfecting mail
  packages](https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/1872344/thailand-begins-disinfecting-packages).
  I don't know if this is necessary or not, but you might consider
  spraying down amazon boxes with lysol before picking them up

### Europe:

* French police are [threatening to invoke their right](https://twitter.com/Deven_Intel/status/1235571307112214528)
  not to enforce the law if the French government does not supply them appropriate PPE by March 9th
* Netherlands top health authority [intentionally suppressed news](https://www.telegraaf.nl/video/1287078306/coronapatient-mocht-niks-zeggen-van-ggd) about
  infection, telling patient to keep quiet. Confirmed infected
  individual was not quarantined

### US:

* [Coronavirus Testing designated an 'essential health
  benefit'](https://twitter.com/francoordonez/status/1235276782477205504?s=21),
  which means that insurers, medicare, and medicaid _must_ cover it. I
  am still skeptical that anyone is getting tested at all
* The Feds [finally admit that they are liars](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-05/u-s-won-t-meet-coronavirus-test-rollout-goal-senators-say?utm_content=business&cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic). Test kits won't be available for days or weeks.
* [CDC started reporting state level infected counts
  again](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html).
  Reminder that these numbers are off by at least a factor of ten, due to
  lack of testing
* [Apple pulls
  out](https://appleosophy.com/2020/03/04/apple-gets-out-of-sxsw-due-to-coronavirus/)
  of SXSW. Please, please, please, let enough people pull out that they
  cancel it.
* [Medical Screener at
  LAX](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/medical-screener-lax-airport-tests-positive-coronavirus-n1149986)
  tests positive for Coronavirus. Normally I wouldn't report something
  like this ("oooh another person got infected" WE KNOW) but this is a
  useful pretense to highlight: CANCEL ALL YOUR TRAVEL PLANS. Travelling
  by air puts you in close contact with a lot of people and you have no
  way of knowing if they're sick or not. It is likely that this disease
  will be spread far and wide by the very same people tasked with stopping
  it (since they come into the most contact with infected) so the easiest
  way to stay safe is to avoid those people. Your trip can wait.
* ~~Port of Seattle [before and after
  pictures](https://imgur.com/a/yCC9ASZ/). International shipping is
  fucked and our economy is going to get super fucked real soon~~ This
  is fake
* [First confirmed infection in
  Nevada](https://www.kolotv.com/content/news/Report-First-coronavirus-case-confirmed-in-Nevada-568521011.html).
  Said it before, I'll say it again: Assume that there are (unconfirmed)
  cases in literally every state except _maybe_ Alaska
* [Quarantined
  nurse](https://twitter.com/mattdpearce/status/1235688983603994625)
  in northern California who has since become sick is
  stonewalled when she tries to get tested.
* [California declares state of
  emergency](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa/california-declares-emergency-over-coronavirus-as-death-toll-rises-in-u-s-idUSKBN20R28H?feedType=RSS&feedName=domesticNews&utm_source=reddit.com).
  This is getting so absurd I think I will stop reporting state-level
  things like this. Just assume every state has cases and will or has
  declared emergency
* RUMINT: [NYC making plans to shut down mass transit once they pass
  1000 cases](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wuhan_Flu/comments/fdx75y/nyc_mass_transit_shit_is_about_to_get_real/0).
  Be aware that r/wuhan_flu is considered to be unreliable by the
  authorities (it is a quarantined subreddit and you will need to log in
  to view it
* Cruise ship "Grand Princess" off the coast of San Francisco being
  denied permission to dock. I lost the link for this one. 


### Canada:

* Canadian military expecting [25% absentee
  rate](https://globalnews.ca/news/6631960/coronavirus-canadian-military-pandemic-planning/).
  At least they're planning for it
* Two Canadian insurance companies [stop covering Coronavirus-related trip cancellations](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/coronavirus-manulife-tugo-travel-insurance-1.5486117).
  I understand why they'd do this but this is bad, it's going to encourage
  more people to not cancel trips. DO NOT BOOK ANY TRIPS FOR THE NEAR
  FUTURE

### Tech:

* [RUMINT](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=rumint):
  Linkedin California offices closed, mandatory WFH. I can't confirm
  this in actual news yet, but I trust the source.
* Microsoft HQ in Redmond [tells employees to work from
  home](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/fdo74s/microsoft_hq_asking_all_employees_to_work_from/).
  I'm working on confirming if this was a suggestion or an order
* Google tells Seattle-area [employees to work from
  home](https://twitter.com/DeItaOne/status/1235582509922074624?s=20).
  Unclear if suggestion or command

### Science/Medical:

* [Research paper from 13 years
  ago](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/208354) about
  nonpharmaceutical interventions during the [Spanish Flu
  epidemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu_epidemic). TL;DR:
  The faster that schools and public places were closed, the fewer people
  died. _**CALL YOUR LOCAL POLITICIANS AND TELL THEM TO SHUT DOWN EVERYTHING**_
* Australian National University [did some pandemic
  modelling](https://anu.prezly.com/coronavirus-is-highly-uncertain-and-the-costs-could-be-high).
  It's not looking good. In the best-case pandemic scenario, they get
  15 million worldwide deaths. In the worst-case scenario, 68 million.
  [Direct link to research paper](https://cdn.uc.assets.prezly.com/f608a96a-ca11-4a06-99ec-adb478629363/-/inline/no/)
* Dr. Campbell's video today [explained the S-CoV & L-CoV dual
  strains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYPZHA-UjUY) I posted about
  yesterday
* Contra what our health authorities tell us, [Hong Kong Medical
  Authorities](https://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking-news/section/4/143091/Ho-Pak-leung-says-up-to-5pc-Wuhan-evacuees-may-be-infected)
  believe that everyone wearing masks is why they haven't seen more
  infections
* Study suggests that [Children get infected just as
  much](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.03.20028423v1),
  but don't get as sick / don't get sick as often. Weirdly good news, in
  a way, but also makes quarantine that much harder, and the school
  closures we're not getting that much more important

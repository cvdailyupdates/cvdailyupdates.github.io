### USA

* [All air traffic around NYC was grounded
  today](https://twitter.com/ChaseWPatterson/status/1241423753273208832)
  for a few hours. I'm not sure exactly what happened but I assume it
  was an ATC found infected
* Hat-tip a reader: Washington State appears to be severely bottlenecked
  on testing, processing only about 3k a day. The reader claims a medlab
  friend says they're still short on testing equipment, which flies in
  the face of what our Coronavirus czar says every day in the briefings
* [55% of NY State cases are age
  18-49](https://twitter.com/nygovcuomo/status/1241387847220936706?s=21).
  This stat is less useful than it appears, because a) that's a large age
  range; and b) who cares about diagnoses we want to know the rate of
  _severe_ cases. Still, it underscores what we've known for a while
  now: young people are absolutely not immune to this.

### Europe

* Italy [going full Martial
  Law](https://twitter.com/RachelDonadio/status/1241497564656123904?s=20)
  on their lockdown

### Middle East

* Israel intends to do what Netherlands said they're going to do, and [do
  mass random
  sampling](https://twitter.com/AmichaiStein1/status/1241436550765969414)
  of the population with antibody tests.

### Science/Medical

* [WE HAVE AN ANTIBODY TEST](https://coronachecktest.com/) (Pending FDA
  approval) with a unit cost of $20. They expect to ship the first
  15,000 in about a week. This will be invaluable for identifying who is
  now immune. I would like to get my hands on one, although I expect that
  as a very low-priority case it will be difficult. If any medical
  personnel read my site and can somehow hook me up (with this or any
  other antibody test), please email me: cvdailyupdates at protonmail dot

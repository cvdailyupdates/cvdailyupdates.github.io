### Asia

* [Evidence that China has dramatically undercounted their
  deaths?](https://mobile.twitter.com/jenniferatntd/status/1243254645935521798).
  China claims they've had about 3000 deaths, total, nationwide. This
  _one single funeral home_ claims they have 6000 urns to give out. Note
  that the source is one that gives me an ambiguously bad feeling. I have
  no particular reason to question the reliability, but it's just a hunch.
  Exercise appropriate skepticism. See also [Bloomberg's
  coverage](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-27/stacks-of-urns-in-wuhan-prompt-new-questions-of-virus-s-toll)

### Europe

* [Boris Johnson tests positive for
  coronavirus](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-52060791). I guess he's
  leading from the front lines in the battle for herd immunity. Joking
  aside, I hope his case is a mild one. If his case goes mild, a lot of
  people will feel very reassured about this pandemic. If he dies in a
  week, then y'all better start stockpiling ammo because this shit is
  getting crazy
* [Evidence that Italy has dramatically undercounted their
  deaths?](https://www.corriere.it/politica/20_marzo_26/the-real-death-toll-for-covid-19-is-at-least-4-times-the-official-numbers-b5af0edc-6eeb-11ea-925b-a0c3cdbe1130.shtml?refresh_ce-cp).
  In this article is a graph showing, for one town, the average fatality
  rate for the past few years (blue), the coronavirus fatalities (green)
  and the actual fatality rate for right now (red). You'll notice that
  the red line spikes quite a bit higher than the green one, and you'll
  notice that the red line doesn't look like the blue line at all (we
  would expect it to, unless some unique one-off event was killing a bunch
  of people). It's suggestive, not evidence, but it sure looks like the
  "real" death count is the red line

### USA

* [The Army Corps of Engineers build a
  hospital](https://twitter.com/NYGovCuomo/status/1243583774627168257)
  for NYC in about a week. I bet this one doesn't leak, unlike _some_
  one-week hospitals
* The US broke 100k infections today. I want off Mr Coronavirus's Wild
  Ride

### Science/Medical

* [COVID-19 attack rate increases with city
  size](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20041004v1).
  This is something of a no-brainer (denser population = more transmission
  opportunities) but it's good to quantify it
* [ACE-2 blockers associated to mitigation of disease
  severity](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.20.20039586v1)
  This is somewhat to be expected. The virus attacks ACE-2 receptors.
  Blocking those receptors means they can't be attacked
* [Preliminary study showing convalescent plasma being a very effective
  treatment](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763983).
  Note that there is no control group. More investigation needed
* [Something about the virus mutating to become more
  infective](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.991844v2.full.pdf).
  I haven't read the paper in full and I'm not sure I understand the
  practical implications
* [Serology characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection since the exposure
  and post symptoms
  onset](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.20041707v1).
  This looks at the biochemical markers of immune response throughout
  peoples' infections. If I understand this correctly, they are typical
  from what you'd expect in a disease. That means that a) antibody tests
  should be easy to make and work as normal; and b) the immunity situation
  should be normal (eg no weird 'get it a second time' stuff). As always,
  I am not a doctor
* [Melatonin as a potential adjuvant
  treatment](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024320520303313).
  I think this is theorizing more than it's observing, but if so, good
  news; I take this stuff nightly as a sleep aid. For further good news,
  they say it would be helpful mostly because it's an antioxidant. A lot
  of things are antioxidants, so if their conclusions are correct, this
  would recommend a lot of other things as effective treatments. Vitamin
  C, perhaps?

### Markets

* [There is a looming condom
  shortage](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-malaysia-karex/condom-shortage-looms-after-coronavirus-lockdown-shuts-worlds-top-producer-idUSKBN21E1OJ).
  The world's largest condom factory has been offline for a week now.

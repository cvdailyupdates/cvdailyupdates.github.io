### 2020.03.15

In the past 24 hours I did a review of what was posted on /r/covid19,
which is the science-based coronavirus subreddit. Lots of interesting
papers. Most are cause for mild optimism, some are concerning. Keep your
eyes on the Science/Medical section today.

Keep in mind that many of these are preprints, and haven't been
peer-reviewed yet. Like literally everything else on this website, the
situation is chaotic and fluid. Things can be wrong, and are subject to
change. But this is what's going around, and I bring it back to you, the
people. Judge the papers for yourselves

### Asia

* [The Epoch
  Times](https://twitter.com/EpochTimes/status/1234968495261175808) with
  some in-depth reporting suggesting that China lies about numbers

  Their blanket shutdown appears to have destroyed their society. Get
  ready, that's coming here soon

### Europe

* Austria on full lockdown.

### US

* [THE FIRST MANDATORY LOCKDOWN MEASURES IN THE US HAVE BEEN
  IMPLEMENTED](https://www.insider.com/hoboken-implements-coronavirus-curfew-restaurant-bar-restrictions-2020-3).
  Hoboken, NJ to implement curfew. Nobody to leave their houses between
  10pm and 5am. Lockdowns are coming sooner rather than later. _**I
  strongly urge everyone to pause all travel plans indefinitely, as if you
  travel you may not be permitted to return home if a lockdown is
  implemented while you are gone**_

### Science/Medical

* [Potential false-positive rate among the 'asymptomatic infected
  individuals' in close contacts of COVID-19
  patients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/32133832/). I am not
  statistically literate enough to understand what this page says, but it
  _think_ it's saying that four out of five tests are false positives.
* [Real estimate of mortality following COVID-19
  infection](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20\)30195-X/fulltext).
  This paper points out that the correct denominator for the death rate
  isn't total cases, it's total cases three weeks ago, because it takes
  about 3 weeks to progress to death. Using this, this paper estimates a
  5.7% fatality rate. Obviously this is highly sensitive to assumptions
  about the "real" case count
* [Letter written by Italian doctor suggesting that smoking is a SERIOUS
  comorbidity](https://www.iss.it/web/guest/primo-piano/-/asset_publisher/o4oGR9qmvUz9/content/id/5294087).
  TBH this reads to me like anti-smoking propaganda, but it makes sense
* [The convalescent sera options for containing
  COVID-19](https://www.jci.org/articles/view/138003). Basically, inject
  blood plasma from recovered patients, and the magic antibodies or
  whatever that are inside save peoples' lives.
* [Estimating the asymptomatic proportion of coronavirus disease 2019
  (COVID-19) cases on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship, Yokohama,
  Japan,
  2020](https://eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.10.2000180).
  Using the Diamond Princess as a natural experiment, they estimate that
  approximately 15-20% of all cases are asymptomatic
* [Of Chloroquine and
  COVID-19](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354220301145)
  looks at the data about using Chloroquine to treat COVID-19. It works
  in vitro but historically in-vitro results did not translate into
  in-vivo for this drug. More study is needed
* [Reinfection could not occur in SARS-CoV-2 infected rhesus
  macaques](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.990226v1).
  People have been worrying about reinfection after recovery but this
  study suggests that this will not happen, at least on the order of weeks
* Twitter thread about [younger
  infections](https://twitter.com/DrEricDing/status/1239041092978343937).
  This guy claims there is data that the entire course of disease is
  milder in younger people on average. However, there is still no actual
  data demonstrating this, only claims. Maybe there is in the primary
  source, but I don't speak Korean. Note that in the chart he posted,
  "critical rate" is a mistranslation and it is clearly the death rate.
* Another Twitter thread of [someone talking to a Seattle doctor](https://twitter.com/scott_mintzer/status/1239290389963714562).
  Concerning claim that it's not actually respiratory distress that is
  killing people, but acute myocarditis that happens shortly afterwards.
  There were rumours of this a month ago but they never came to much.
* Twitter thread doing a [roundup of some research
  papers](https://twitter.com/davidasinclair/status/1238972082756648960).
  Specifically, the genes present in the coronavirus predict that it
  should interfere with heme groups in your blood. This is bad.
* [Breakthrough by German
  scientists](https://twitter.com/ARanganathan72/status/1239263724487069696)
  analyzing the specific protein the coronavirus uses for cellular entry.
  Extremely good news, as it predicts that an existing drug, one that is
  pretty cheap too, blocks coronavirus entry. And it seems that that is
  exactly what happened in their experiments. THIS IS NOT MEDICAL
  ADVICE, but if you have a favourite 'not for human consumption' website
  for ordering drugs, you might want to order some

* Sobering reminder: [Risk of Vaccine Research and Development
  Quantified](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3603987/).
  "The average vaccine, taken from the preclinical phase, requires a
  development timeline of 10.71 years and has a market entry probability
  of 6%."
* This Week In Virology episode interviewing Dr. Ralph Baric about
  coronavirus. [Medium post summary with link to the
  episode](https://medium.com/@hpcngmoh/you-will-be-hard-pressed-to-find-higher-quality-virological-information-during-this-outbreak-as-a1c7b53d686a).
  Lots of stuff here but the interesting new data is that, for complex
  and well-thought-out reasons, this doctor believes that once the initial
  pandemic is over (noting this may take years), the coronavirus should
  quickly evolve to be less deadly, eventually becoming just another
  common cold. However, this might be less a "virus becomes less lethal"
  and more a "the _children_ who survived are more-or-less immune for
  life, and pass that on to their children"
* [First 12 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the
  United
  States](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.20032896v1.full.pdf).
  Research paper with some interesting stats about the first twelve
  identified cases in the US. Overall interesting, and I think somewhat
  good news.

### Markets

* The fed did a bunch more stuff that probably won't work and that I
  don't understand. This remains really really bad

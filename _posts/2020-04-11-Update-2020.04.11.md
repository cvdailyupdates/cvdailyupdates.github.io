### Updates

* Interesting deep dive into the [press archives of the Canadian city of
  Winnipeg](https://twitter.com/brent_bellamy/status/1248413252410683394).
  If you, like me, have been wondering "what kind of public health
  measures did they even take during Spanish Flu", then here's your
  answer. Short version: they did pretty much the same thing we're doing
  now, including having the same arguments and making the same mistakes
* [Factors associated with hospitalization and critical
  illness](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.08.20057794v1)
  among 4,103 patients with COVID-19 disease in New York City. Pretty
  much reinforces what we know: biggest risk factors are age, obesity, and
  hypertension. Risk for young healthy people is much lower but still not
  low
* [Hospitalization Rates and Characteristics of Patients Hospitalized with
  Laboratory-Confirmed Coronavirus Disease
  2019](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/pdfs/mm6915e3-H.pdf).
  Similar paper. Hospitalization rate for 18-49 is 2.5/100k, compare
  average 4.6 and 13.8/100k over 65.

  [life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), has
  [died of
  coronavirus](https://www.i-programmer.info/news/82-heritage/13614-john-conway-dies-from-coronavirus.html)
* [Boris Johnson has been discharged from the hospital. It seems he
  recovered](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-52262012)
* [Research

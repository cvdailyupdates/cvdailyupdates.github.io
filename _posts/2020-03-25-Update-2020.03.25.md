### USA

* [Atlanta mayor says ICUs are at
  capacity](https://twitter.com/shongables/status/1242548471455981569).
  This is the part where this gets really, really bad
* [LA is enforcing shutdown orders by killing utilities to commercial
  properties](https://ktla.com/news/coronavirus/mayor-garcetti-expected-to-hold-daily-briefing-on-l-a-s-covid-19-response/).
* [Waffle House closes 365 locations in the US](https://www.wafb.com/2020/03/24/waffle-house-closes-locations-across-us/). My American friends inform me that this is Very Significant, as Waffle House _**never**_ closes.
* [Amazon Workers test positive at six U.S.
  Warehouses](https://archive.is/psDzG). I have been disinfecting the
  boxes that my packages come in, but I have not been disinfecting the
  things inside the boxes. I will have to change this protocol.
* Texas has hit 1000 confirmed cases.
* [The governor of
  Kentucky](https://www.cnet.com/news/how-kentucky-became-a-surprising-leader-in-flattening-the-curve-on-covid-19/)
  is becoming something of a social media darling for his handling the
  coronavirus pandemic much better than other leaders. It is unclear to me
  what, _specifically_, he's doing differently from other leaders, aside
  from implementing lockdowns earlier. But I'm informed that he's an
  example of a good leader, and this is a good profile of his acts.
* [Guy on
  /r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fm7f4c/nyc_hospitals_will_soon_hit_capacity/)
  says that a major hospital in NYC is at capacity and triaging
  ventilator access.
* A personal friend of mine reports that a friend of their father
  collapsed unexpectedly today. He later became diagnosed with
  Coronavirus. I consider this to be an ironclad proof that those
  'collapsing in the street' videos from China are real. He also
  confirms that the hospital he was taken to is at capacity, and has
  no more ICU space
* [We've graduated from quarantine cruises to quarantine aircraft
  carriers](https://www.businessinsider.com/sailors-aboard-a-us-navy-aircraft-carrier-have-the-coronavirus-2020-3).
  "Three cases of COVID-19 have been identified among personnel
  currently deployed and underway on the USS Theodore Roosevelt

### Europe

* [Prince Charles tests
  positive](https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-prince-charles-tests-positive-for-covid-19-11963363).
  Poor guy is _never_ gonna get to be king.
* [Woman, 21, 'with no pre-existing conditions dies of
  coronavirus'](https://metro.co.uk/2020/03/25/woman-21-no-pre-existing-conditions-dies-coronavirus-12454333/).
  This is one singular anecdote, and not data. I really wish we had more
  robust data about the relative severity risk by age bracket. But this is
  still concerning.


### Science/Medical

* [Men who are
  infected](https://twitter.com/AndyBiotech/status/1242587131463245824)
  get their hormones all fucked up. Two months ago there was some
  preliminary rumours that male fertility might be impacted by this, but
  they were very preliminary and not very reliable. This seems to suggest
  that those rumours may have been real. It is unclear to me if this is
  a selection bias thing though (eg people with these imbalances are at
  higher risk of getting sick). It's also important to note that these
  hormones are measured _while people are sick_, and it's unclear if the
  disruption persists after you recover
* [Face Masks: Much More Than You Wanted To
  Know](https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/03/23/face-masks-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/).
  This blog is very high quality, generally reputable, and written by an
  actual M.D. He has done a meta-analysis of all the data available with
  respect to masks
* Prolonged presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in faecal
  samples. Stupid Lancet links have fucking parens in them and it breaks
  the markdown link formatter, so URL here: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langas/article/PIIS2468-1253(20)30083-2/fulltext).
  They found that evidence of viral RNA could be found in stool samples
  for, in one case up to 33 days after their respiratory tests became
  negative/their symptoms ended. This is concerning and requires more
  study, but it is also important to note that this study did not
  determine if those viral particles were still infectious or not.
  Shedding inactivated viral particles for a few weeks after you're not
  sick anymore is not particularly unusual, and is not necessarily cause
  for alarm.
* Robin Hanson with [A bunch of
  data](https://twitter.com/robinhanson/status/1242655704663691264) suggesting
  that there is a dose-response relationship between initial viral
  exposure and severity of illness. If true, this could have some
  uncomfortable implications. For one: you're likely to be exposed to a
  lower viral load from touching a contaminated handrail in public than
  you are from quarantining in a house with sick loved ones. If true,
  quarantine measures may dramatically _increase_ disease severity. I do
  not endorse his conclusions as true, but he links a lot of interesting
  papers on the subject
* [UK claims it's days away from releasing millions of antibody
  tests](https://www.theage.com.au/world/europe/game-changer-britain-days-away-from-releasing-millions-of-coronavirus-finger-prick-tests-20200326-p54dyy.html).
  This changes everything. I didn't realize that we had antibody tests
  outside of research labs at all. But they claim they have 3.5 million
  and are ready to ship them to pharmacies in _days_. This implies that
  they have a highly scalable process for manufacture. This implies that
  the US could license the tech and manufacture _millions_ per week. We
  could test people and formally certify them as (very probably) immune to
  the virus. We could test people to figure out who is safe to let out of
  quarantine. If this could be deployed at scale, soon, then Trump's
  insane plan to end lockdowns by Easter starts to look actually realistic
  (at least for the subset of population that is already immune)

### Markets

* [Indeed releases data showing how job-search numbers have
  changed](https://www.hiringlab.org/2020/03/23/coronavirus-and-us-job-postings/)
  during this crisis. They're... not good, but surprisingly not as bad as
  you'd expect. Job postings are still above January levels.

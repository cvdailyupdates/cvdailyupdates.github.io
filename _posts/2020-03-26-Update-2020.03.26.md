### Updates

Today was an exceptionally slow news day. I have two updates, and I
didn't bother to save sources on either of them:

* The US has officially passed China in confirmed infections. Does the
  US have more infections than China? I believe this zero
* US and Canada are in talks about having the US military secure the
  northern border. It is unclear to me what the specifics of this are
  but the US/Can border is the longest (in terms of time) undefended (in
  terms of military) border in human history. If they're actually doing
  that, that's really big. I guess I'm definitely not going back to
  Canada any time soon

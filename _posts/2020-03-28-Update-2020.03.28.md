### Personal

* The first coronavirus-related death in my county. 70 y/o woman with
  'significant underlying health conditions'
* My city has posted a map of confirmed cases broken out by city
  district. My district has the highest number of confirmed cases, at
  around 30. It's ok, I didn't want to go outside anyway.

### Asia

* [More stories of a significant number of recovered people re-testing
  positive](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/27/822407626/mystery-in-wuhan-recovered-coronavirus-patients-test-negative-then-positive).
  I still believe this is _something weird_ that is not a reinfection. I
  do not believe that people will get seriously ill from this disease
  weeks after they've already recovered from it

### USA

* [One of Joe Biden's advisors died of
  COVID-19](https://www.bostonherald.com/2020/03/27/larry-rasky-boston-pr-guru-tests-positive-for-coronavirus-after-his-death-son/)
* Contrary to popular belief, [the virus is _not_ a conspiracy that the
  government is using to keep us all in our homes while they change the
  batteries in all the birds](https://www.instagram.com/p/B-A525GgWTd/)
* Another [sudden death
  case](https://www.bigcountryhomepage.com/news/state-news/perfectly-healthy-texas-dad-dies-after-contracting-coronavirus-family-says/).
  I wish we had proper data, because "how many anecdotes did I read
  about this in the media" is not the way you find out how prevalent this
  is
* [Trump is making suggestions that he might put NY under cordon, the
  way Wuhan
  was](https://twitter.com/kellyo/status/1243936044568977409?s=12). I
  don't have the link handy but Cuomo is not a fan of this plan. We
  would be going into politically uncharted waters if anything like that
  happened. Or, as one friend put it: "the Democrats finally understand
  the boogaloo". In all seriousness, shit like this is how you provoke a
  second civil war, and we don't really need that on top of our other
  problems right now. Meanwhile, the disease is established in enough
  other metro areas that putting a cordon around NY wouldn't accomplish
  much.

### International

* [There's a new cruise ship](https://twitter.com/CadieThompson/status/1243583711377006594). Nobody will let them dock, and four people have died so far. 

### Science/Medical

* [Smokers are much _less_ likely to become severe
  cases???](https://mobile.twitter.com/KlausKblog/status/1242995506118307840?s=19)
* [A cat was infected in
  Belgium](https://nypost.com/2020/03/27/first-known-cat-infected-with-coronavirus-reported-in-belgium/).
  Note that this isn't simply a case of a cat _testing_ as infected. The
  cat actually got sick. Seems to be an isolated case, but it happened
* [ARBs dramatically reduce the severity of COVID19, maybe?](https://twitter.com/__philipn__/status/1239432114862297088). I have no idea what an ARB is
* [Coronavirus pandemic could inflict emotional trauma and PTSD on an
  unprecidented
scale](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/27/coronavirus-pandemic-could-inflict-long-lasting-emotional-trauma-ptsd.html).
  I get what they're trying to say but the hyperbolic headline is rather
  offensive, tbh. The people who survived Spanish Flu didn't have PTSD?
  You know, they came out of the most horrendous war the world had ever
  seen and then bam they get hit with a plague that kills 3% of the planet
  or whatever. I'm sure this pandemic is causing very real and very severe
  mental health issues for people, but "unprecidented"? Worse than the
  institution of slavery? Worse than the impact of the Holocaust? Nuclear
  weapons? Soviet/Maoist purges? Famine during the siege of Leningrad? The
  black plague? I could keep going but I hope this illustrates the
  point. It's going to be bad but, please, a little perspective.
* [Interesting data on
  comorbidities](https://www.covidgraph.com/p/coronavirus.html#usaitaly).
  It really does look like people who don't have any underlying health
  problems have a much brighter prognosis. Interestingly, it's mostly
  underlying heart diseases, not lung diseases

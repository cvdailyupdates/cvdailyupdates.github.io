### USA

* [Harvey Weinstein tests
  positive](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danafeldman/2020/03/22/harvey-weinstein-has-reportedly-tested-positive-for-coronavirus/#16c12c746518)
* [Rand Paul tests
  positive](https://twitter.com/RandPaul/status/1241780756617273345).
  Something something it punched him in the ribs. Referential humour!
* [Dallas county gets shelter-in-place
  order](https://www.fox4news.com/news/shelter-at-home-order-issued-for-dallas-county).
  Interestingly, this one was issued by a judge, not an elected executive.
  Presumably that means that it won't be enforced by the cops, but rather
  the Texas Marshalls. You realize what this means, right? Dallas is under
  _**MARSHALL**_ LAW

### Europe

* [Angela Merkel in

### Science/Medical

* [Patients who initially present with GI symptoms instead of
  respiratory
  symptoms](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/fmq6bb/digestive_symptoms_tied_to_worse_covid19_outcomes/)
  have worse outcomes. I linked reddit instead of the actual paper because
  the paper is soft-paywalled
* [Loss of sense of
  smell](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/loss-of-smell-may-be-a-sign-of-covid-19-infection-doctors-groups-1.4863341)
  is now allegedly a symptom of coronavirus. I mean, isn't this a symptom
  of anything that gives you sinus congestion?

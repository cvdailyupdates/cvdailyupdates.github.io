confirm but does it seem to anyone else like that deaths number is
getting bigger WAAAAAY faster than that recoveries number?

### USA

* Congress is trying to use the crisis to [start the
  boogaloo](https://www.firearmspolicy.org/oppose-hr-5717-federal-gunpocalypse).
  This seems unwise
* [New York City will run
  out](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/coronavirus-new-york-city-medical-supplies-mayor-bill-de-blasio-latest-updates-a9412891.html)
  of medical supplies within three weeks.
* [US government
  allegedly](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-utilities/u-s-power-industry-may-ask-key-employees-to-live-at-work-if-coronavirus-worsens-idUSKBN2171AC) going to ask the operators of utilities to live in their power plants and such, to make sure they keep running. This is consistent with rumours I've been hearing for two weeks now
* [National shelter-in-place is coming,
  apparently](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/washington-secrets/trump-eyes-grounding-jets-halting-stock-trading-ording-shelter-in-place)
* New York State implements shelter-in-place type rules.
* Concerningly high fraction of [young people infected](https://twitter.com/ScottGottliebMD/status/1241038035287973890)
  in New York. Still really wish I had more reliable information on
  relative severity by age group

### Science/Medical

* [Supplementing Vitamin
  D](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28202713) probably helps with
  avoiding infection

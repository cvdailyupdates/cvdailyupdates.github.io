### Updates

* Old theory: Coronavirus breaks blood's ability to carry oxygen. New
  theory: Coronavirus causes widespread blood clotting which clogs
  capillaries and prevents tissues from getting oxygen. [Extremely
  complicated medical argument for this
  position](http://farid.jalali.one/covid19emailpdf.pdf)
* [More reinfection
  rumours](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/04/10/south-korea-reports-recovered-coronavirus-patients-testing-positive/).
  TL;DR: 1% of recovered patients in South Korea test positive for
  coronavirus infection again. _Some of them get sick again_. This is
  concerning but there is still not enough context. Are they getting sick
  _again_ or are they getting sick _still_? Because every time I've seen
  actual context data around this, it's "they get sick again _a week or
  two later_" and at that point I'm not sure what the meaningful
  difference between 'sick again' and 'sick still' is. Still, worth
  keeping an eye on. If coronavirus refinfection on the order of weeks is
  possible, then I'm upgrading this crisis from "huh it actually looks
  pretty ok" to "I will get my website shut down by a social media mob if
  I give my real thoughts on the matter"

  Seems to support the widespread clotting hypothesis
* Twitter guy seems to think, if I understand correctly, that [the
  cytokine storm is triggered by white blood cells getting
  infected](https://twitter.com/__ice9/status/1248496496728666112) and
  then killing themselves, which spills their cytokine reserves into the
  bloodstream

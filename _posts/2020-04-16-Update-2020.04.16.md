### Updates

* A few weeks ago I mentioned that the Dutch are doing antibody testing
  of their donated blood supply to see how prevalent antibodies are.
  [The study is done, and apparently 3% of Dutch people have COVID
  antibodies](https://nltimes.nl/2020/04/16/3-dutch-blood-donors-covid-19-antibodies)
* [Interesting round-up of vaccine technologies, how they work, and how
  they're being applied to
  Coronavirus](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/04/15/coronavirus-vaccine-prospects)
* An academic paper, published pseudonymously, [presenting the data that
  the Coronavirus leaked from a lab](https://projectepstein.github.io/)

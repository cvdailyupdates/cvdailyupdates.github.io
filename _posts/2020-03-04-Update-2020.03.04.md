### Website and Links:

* Added [About the Virus](../../about/ncov.md) page

  you know at a glance what events have been cancelled.

### Personal

* A friend of mine found out today that a personal contact of his in the
  Bay Area is confirmed infected. 60 year old man. He is currently in
  self-quarantine at home and seems to be doing well so far

### Iran:

* [Iran has mobilized the
  army](https://globalnews.ca/news/6622645/iran-coronavirus-death-toll-army/) to deal with the plague

### India

* [India is rapidly gaining
  cases](https://twitter.com/WarsontheBrink/status/1235064476870651906?s=20). I'm honestly surprised they went this long without finding any. Given what I've heard of the state of public sanitation in India, this could be _very_ bad

### Korea:

* [Hospital bed shortage in
  Korea](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-southkorea/thousands-wait-for-hospital-beds-in-south-korea-as-coronavirus-cases-surge-idUSKBN20R05M).
  Pay close attention to this, it's just a matter of _**weeks**_ before
  the US has the same problem

### Italy:

* [Italy to close all schools due to
  coronavirus](https://twitter.com/bnodesk/status/1235187396251127811?s=21)

### China:

* Nothing to report

### Singapore:

* Singaporean government has [released an online
  dashboard](https://co.vid19.sg/dashboard)

### WHO:

* Nothing to report

### Europe:

* Confirmed infection [in EU offices in
  Brussels](https://twitter.com/BNODesk/status/1235164637739601921?s=09)

### Israel:

* Possible [exposure at
  AIPAC](https://twitter.com/cnbc/status/1235392555195514885?s=21).
  (Yes, I know this is technically in the US, but the US section was
  already too big)
* [Tens of thousands](https://www.jpost.com/Breaking-News/Three-new-cases-of-coronavirus-announced-in-Israel-619680) under some level of quarantine or self-isolation in Israel

### US:

* [Pence claims we can start testing in force next
  week](https://twitter.com/katierogers/status/1234977487190290432?s=21) given all the rumours we see about tests being denied and tests not working, I'm pressing X to doubt this.
* [People continue to
  claim](https://twitter.com/thehill/status/1235227029043318785?s=21)
  that testing is being denied to them.
* CDC claims [testing now offered with nothing but doctor's
  approval](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/04/health/coronavirus-test-demand.html?referringSource=articleShare).
  I remain baffled as to why the fuck hospitals didn't just test and damn
  the consequences
* [No audio or video was allowed at the recent Coronavirus
  briefing](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/fd496w/white_house_does_not_allow_video_or_audio/). This is extremely ominous
* Bay area spread increases with [first case confirmed in Berkeley](https://www.berkeleyside.com/2020/03/03/city-of-berkeley-reports-first-coronavirus-patient). I have friends who live there, I hope they will be ok.
* Emerald City Comic Con in Seattle is still on next week.
* [Continued
  reports](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUS/comments/fd6f8c/my_friend_and_his_wife_and_kid_just_came_through/) that screening in US airports is non-existant.
* [California reports first coronavirus
  death](https://twitter.com/BNODesk/status/1235283973670137856)
* [LA County declares state of emergency](https://twitter.com/bnodesk/status/1235243372283129856?s=21)
* [There is a new cruise ship under
  quarantine](https://twitter.com/bnodesk/status/1235358098505728003?s=21)
  off the coast of San Francisco. To be honest, it's been what, two
  weeks since the Diamond Princess quarantine ended, and as far as I know
  only about 10% of the passengers who were infected had serious
  illness. This could be wrong, of course, as I imagine it's impossible to
  follow up on everyone after they went home
* Miami postpones [Ultra Music
  Festival](https://twitter.com/miamiherald/status/1235332517097623552?s=21).
  Thank god, we need more cancellations like this
* [Virus confirmed in
  Houston](https://twitter.com/HoustonPubMedia/status/1235346844579966976)
* [Virus confirmed in New
  Jersey](https://twitter.com/GovMurphy/status/1235375867917930498?s=20)
* Anecdote from a friend: everybody in his WoW guild, most of whom live
  in bumfuck nowhere, USA, know of a presumptive case nearby. This seems
  to be everywhere
* [Anecdote from
  Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusFOS/comments/fdofmd/a_report_from_seattle_its_worse_than_is_being/):
  Situation in Seattle is much worse than we're told. Google allegedly
  censoring Seattle Times in their search results to suppress extent of
  coronavirus infection. 18 confirmed cases, 6 dead, 48 schools closed,
  estimated 2000 undiagnosed cases. Be aware that r/CoronavirusFOS is
  relatively unmoderated, and judge what you read accordingly


### Canada:

* Bank of Canada [lowers the interest rate by 50 basis
  points](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2020/03/fad-press-release-2020-03-04/),
  following the US' lead. 
* Canadian military [preparing to respond to
  pandemic](https://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/defence-watch/canadian-military-starts-initial-preparations-for-responding-to-pandemic). I expect the US army to have to do similar before this is over.
* Personal eyewitness anecdote from trusted friend: "Costco had lineups before open. They're sanitizing each cart as it comes through the doors. Costco is completely out of store-brand TP. Name brand is being cleared out literally as fast as they can drag pallets onto the floor. Lots of holes in the shelf-stable food section. Walmart is almost as bad re: TP and shelf-stable food. Pharmacy and toiletries sections are wrecked. More open shelving than full in some aisles. Walmart is definitely having supply issues. They can't fill their Easter seasonal displays. This matches with a bunch of regular Easter seasonal stuff not being in stock anywhere. The ethnic shoppers have hit the local wholesale stores. Lots of Canadian food, but ethnic food (specific kinds of beans/lentils/rice) are wiped out.". This matches the reports of US Costcos and Walmarts being emptied too. I am happy to say that where I live, I haven't been to Costco in a few weeks, but Walmart was fully stocked on Saturday. My local grocery store showing a handful of missing SKUs in the pasta aisle, but for all I know they restock on Wednesdays and I went at a bad time. Otherwise, it's good.


### Tech:

* [Amazon employee in Seattle office confirmed
  infected](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/amazon/amazon-employee-in-seattle-has-tested-positive-for-illness-caused-by-coronavirus/). I expect other tech companies to respond to this with aggressive, urgent measures.
* [Indeed has mandated work-from-home for all employees
  worldwide](https://www.kxan.com/news/local/austin/indeed-asks-all-employees-to-work-from-home-halt-business-travel-due-to-coronavirus/). No employees are confirmed infected at this time.
* [Facebook contractor in Seattle confirmed
  infected](https://twitter.com/TedLandK5/status/1235413276420259840)


### Science:

* [Potential successful anti-viral medical
treatment](https://www.theolivepress.es/spain-news/2020/03/02/hiv-drug-successfully-treats-coronavirus-patient-in-medical-first-in-spains-andalucia/)
* Relapse news: the British couple that vlogged from the Diamond Princess [have started testing positive again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGHjq3FPHEE). They don't sound particularly sick to me. Keep an eye on them. If they get sick again, that is very bad news.
* Chinese scientists claim [they've identified two different
  strains](https://academic.oup.com/nsr/advance-article/doi/10.1093/nsr/nwaa036/5775463):
  L-CoV and S-CoV. S-CoV is evolutionarily older. It is milder and more
  surviveable, and makes up ~30% of cases. L-CoV is much more dangerous
  and lethal, and makes up 70% of cases. L-type was more prevalent at the
  early stages of the outbreak but scientists believe it is being selected
  against. Good news, if true, it might mean that this disease will evolve
  quickly to be less lethal
* [Acetyl-L-Carnitine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcarnitine)
  may be useful [for prevening viral infection](https://patents.google.com/patent/US5314689A/en). As always, this site is never medical advice, but ALCAR is cheap and available at your local pharmacy, so it can't hurt if you want to try it
* Team of medical experts [does AMA on
  reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fdf5fq/we_are_a_team_of_medical_experts_following/).
  I am not terribly impressed with their commentary, but overall it is
  good.
* Regeneron claims to [have treatment ready for testing by
  August](https://m.timesunion.com/business/article/Regeneron-hopes-to-have-COVID-19-treatment-by-15104995.php).
  Good news if true, but don't get your hopes up; testing for safety takes
  a considerable amount of time on the best of projects, and anti-virals
  are a hard problem.


### Market:

* Credit Suisse [newsletter about the COVID-19
  pandemic](https://plus.credit-suisse.com/rpc4/ravDocView?docid=V7k0P32AN-XtNl).
  I don't understand nearly enough finance to make sense of this, but it
  sounds like they're saying "we're fucked"

### Politics:

* Nothing to report

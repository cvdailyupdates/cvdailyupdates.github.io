### Website and Links:

* The r/china_flu subreddit is untrustworthy. They are engaging in
  SJW-style language policing, because that is their priority during a
  crisis. From this point forward I strongly advocate people not use them
  as a source. Purely out of spite.

### China:

* Quarantine hotel
  [collapses](https://mobile.twitter.com/BNODesk/status/1236299538073366528)
* China closing [two emergency coronavirus
  hospitals](https://twitter.com/nicho21521787/status/12362628004624261170).
  Here's hoping they can stay closed
* Evidence shifting towards [large undetected iceberg of mild
  cases](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-03-stealth-transmission-fuels-fast-covid-.html).
  I find this intensely reassuring, as it means that the lethality of this
  disease is much lower than originally thought

### Europe:

* For perspective, [two weeks ago Italy had 20 official
  cases](https://www.garda.com/crisis24/news-alerts/316551/italy-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak-spreads-in-northern-italy-february-21-update-3).
  Since then, they've put something like 100,000 peoples' worth of towns
  on full on no-in-no-out lockdown. The US has about 350 official cases
  right now. This would suggest that we should expect Seattle area
  hospitals to be completely swamped within a week, and lockdowns in
  Washington state within two
* Leader of Italy's Democratic Party [tests
  positive](https://www.jpost.com/International/Leader-of-Italys-co-ruling-democratic-party-tests-positive-to-coronavirus-620096).
  I wonder how many politicians we'll lose before this is over. I wonder
  how many we have to lose before they start taking this seriously
* Italy [putting most of northern
  Italy](https://twitter.com/AFP/status/1236394510797516800?s=09) under full cordon. No entry, no
  leaving. [~10M people
  affected](https://twitter.com/VojtechGibis/status/1236393608036716546?s=09)
* Italy [may choose not to
  treat](https://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2020/03/07/coronavirus-i-medici-delle-terapie-intensive-in-lombardia-azioni-tempestive-o-disastrosa-calamita-sanitaria-lipotesi-delle-priorita-daccesso-prima-chi-ha-piu-probabilita-di-sopravvivenza/5729020/) people older than a certain age limit,
  triaging people who have more life left to live. I am assuming that
  the reddit headline on this article is true, but have not read to verify
  it

### US:

* Trump visited the CDC and proceeded to give [horrendously bad
  responses to questions](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/07/politics/fact-check-white-house-coronavirus-contained/index.html).
  He is needlessly politicizing this, using it as a weapon against his
  political opponents, spreading outright lies about the status of
  COVID-19 in this country, and making decisions primarily based on what
  he thinks benefits him. I thought this was funny when he did it about
  things that didn't matter, but this matters, and it's not funny anymore.
* Stanford moving to [all virtual
  classes](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/feq0em/stanford_is_going_virtual_for_the_rest_of_the/)
  for remainder of semester. Presumably a reaction to [finding an
  infected medschool faculty
  member](https://www.stanforddaily.com/2020/03/06/medical-school-faculty-member-tests-positive-for-coronavirus/)
* [First official, police-enforced quarantine
  order](https://www.13abc.com/content/news/-Police-enforced-quarantine-hits-Calif-residential-block-after-mans-coronavirus-death--568561901.html?ref=901).
  It is unclear exactly what they were enforcing. Nobody on the block
  could leave their houses?
* [Some numbers out of the old folks home
  (https://twitter.com/ColeMillerTV/status/1236398655906516992) hit in the
  Seattle area.

### Tech:

* Discord [deleting servers it
  catches](https://twitter.com/Leviticus19_18/status/1236338445456457730) discussing the coronavirus
* Website tracking [which tech companies have instituted WFH
  directives](https://stayinghome.club/)

### Science/Medical:

* Twitter [thread exploring the
  numbers](https://twitter.com/LizSpecht/status/1236095180459003909)
  regarding how this is going to swamp our medical system.
* Reminder that [churches are also highly populated public
  places](https://www.khou.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/church-warns-of-possible-coronavirus-exposure/285-8126c50c-8fb1-44f8-b656-3d08ce7ddd87).
  I know religion is deeply personal for many, and I know it is hard to
  cut oneself off from one's community, but it would be a good idea to
  start watching virtual sermons for the near future
* Diamond Princess [death toll reaches
  7](https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2020-03-07/diamond-princess-passenger-dies-bringing-ships-death-toll-to-seven-nhk).
  To be honest, if the death toll from the Diamond Princess is _only_ 7,
  that's actually extremely optimistic news
* [Research
  roundup](https://twitter.com/mugecevik/status/1236372854171750400)
  thread. Lots of important stuff in there, too much for me to summarize

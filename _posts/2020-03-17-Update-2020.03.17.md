  guard](https://gov.texas.gov/news/post/governor-abbott-activates-national-guard-in-response-to-covid-19).

### Science/Medical

* Personal story from a [39 year old who caught
  this](https://twitter.com/jwdaddy80/status/1239704023998984193)
* An actuary [crunched some numbers from the Diamond
  Princess](https://www.elucidor.com/2020/03/10/corona-virus-risk-analysis/).
  I don't speak actuary, unfortunately, but it looks like some evidence
  in favour of the hypothesis that younger people have _lower_ (but not
  low/zero) risk.
* Canadian company claims it [already has a Coronavirus
  vaccine](https://americanmilitarynews.com/2020/03/weve-got-the-coronavirus-vaccine-says-pentagon-funded-company/).
  I don't know what "has a vaccine" means given that the timeline is still
  12-18 months out
* [People with Type-A blood have increased risk of disease, and people
  with Type-O have reduced
  risk](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.11.20031096v1).
  Glad to count myself, and most of my family, in the type-O master race.
* More evidence [that Chloroquine
  works](https://www.lesechos.fr/idees-debats/sciences-prospective/exclusif-coronavirus-on-sait-guerir-la-maladie-affirme-linfectiologue-didier-raoult-1186129)

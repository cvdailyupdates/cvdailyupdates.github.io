### Personal Updates

Guys I really apologize that the updates have been late, posting the
following morning instead of the day of. Don't worry, nothing crazy
going on with me. In all honesty, now that I'm not sick anymore, I'm
just hanging out at home with my cat, drinking whiskey and repeatedly
taking over the world in
[EU4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_Universalis_IV). That game is
crazy, I sit down to play for half an hour and then I get up and six
hours have passed. I'm going to try to be more disciplined about posting
these updates when I should, but in all honesty the delays will likely
continue until I push all the remaining Muslim powers out of India and
secure it for myself and my Hindu allies

### Updates

* Thread about how Coronavirus is [affecting our food supply
  chains](https://twitter.com/NFUDC/status/1247198445611474945)
* The "Things I Will Not Work With" guy [is posting about
  Coronavirus](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/). After you read
  his latest posts, check out his archives. One of my favourite articles
  is his article on [FOOF](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2010/02/23/things_i_wont_work_with_dioxygen_difluoride), which is a chemical that
  is also an onomatopoeia. "The heater was warmed to approximately 700C. The
  heater block glowed a dull red color, observable with room lights turned
  off. The ballast tank was filled to 300 torr with oxygen, and fluorine was
  added until the total pressure was 901 torr..."
* ["We used to go to the store... before the virus
  came"](https://twitter.com/AlixEHarrow/status/1247518975535308801)
* [Singapore seeing second
  wave](https://twitter.com/ChorzempaMartin/status/1247893963639386117).
  Apparently their public health despotic utopia is not up to the task
  of containment, which is bad; if they can't do it, I doubt anyone else
  can
* New candidate explanation for the weird progression of this disease:
  [glucose-6-phosphate
  dehydrogenase](https://twitter.com/ElieBalesh/status/1247380781703540740)
  enzyme level.
* [Another interesting Twitter account worth
  watching](https://twitter.com/__ice9). He thinks the [virus attacks
  heme groups](https://twitter.com/__ice9/status/1247194151701151745)
  hypothesis is false, and a new hypothesis: "microvascular
  microthrombosis".
* PDF from a doctor in California [outlining this
  hypothesis](http://farid.jalali.one/covid19emailpdf.pdf)
* [Boris Johnson gets to live,
  apparently](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/09/uk/boris-johnson-improving-coronavirus-uk-gbr-intl/index.html).
  He's like 15 days into his illness, he's been in the ICU for 3 days but
  not intubated. This means his case is very unlikely to progress to
  critical. He will probably live. Well, either that or they're lying
  about his status. That wouldn't surprise me in this crisis

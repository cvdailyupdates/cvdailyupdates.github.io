### Official Numbers

The Johns Hopkins dashboard shit the bed today, it's showing 150,000
_fewer_ infected than yesterday. I think it _might_ have accidentally
lost US numbers. In any case, I'm not putting in the effort to figure
out the real numbers. I will wait and hopefully this is fixed by
tomorrow. If not, I will find a new source

In my City:

* 305 confirmed infections in my city
* 16 confirmed infections in my ZIP code (Î” 0)
* 3 confirmed deaths in my city

### Updates

* The FDA has approved a [two-minute antibody
  test](https://www.axios.com/fda-coronavirus-two-minute-testing-kit-bodysphere-a665429d-488d-4edf-bd36-9180e2a06e4c.html).
  Company says they can ship 1.5 million per week
* [SARS-CoV-2 can be caught and transmitted by
  cats](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.015347v1).
  Preprint, very preliminary, we can't really conclude anything more than
  "more research is needed. But these scientsts blew a bunch of
  coronavirus up a cat's nose, and then that cat got sick, and then that
  cat sneezed on a different cat, and _that_ cat got sick. This is more
  or less the gist of the paper. Note that it is likely that cats are
  not very good hosts for the virus, and you should definitely not start
  culling cats to stop disease spread or anything
* [Italy publishes daily summary
  infographics](https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/sars-cov-2-sorveglianza-dati).
  This is [today's
  graphic](https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/bollettino/Infografica_1aprile%20ENG.pdf).
  Really interesting to me that they're reporting almost 12,000 deaths,
  but ONLY TWENTY EIGHT were people under the age of 40. They also show
  an overall breakdown by symptom severity and post that almost 20% of
  infected people have basically no symptoms ("paucisymptomatic" means
  "even more mild than the mild category", I assume it's no different from
  spring allergies or something)
* I spoke too soon yesterday about the churches. [Texas governor has
  declared churches
  essential](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/gov-abbott-overrides-san-antonio-bexar-county-rules-on-religious-gatherings-amid-coronavirus-crisis/ar-BB11Zelj?ocid=sf),
  meaning that you can still go to church during lockdown. You definitely
  _**shouldn't**_ go. But you can.
* [COVID wing in a hospital in Italy is empty for the first time in a
  month](https://parma.repubblica.it/cronaca/2020/03/31/foto/coronavirus_dopo_settimane_il_pronto_soccorso_covid_e_vuoto_-_foto-252755699/1/#1). Maybe they're over the peak?
* Jesus Christ, [the US is at 5000
  deaths](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/). That
  was fast. Really, really fast. Doing some quick back-of-the-envelope
  math with a friend the other day, we estimate that it will peak at
  10,000 per day for a week or two, given current trends. This assumes
  significant distancing/lockdown remains in effect
* ["China lied, people
  died"](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-01/china-concealed-extent-of-virus-outbreak-u-s-intelligence-says)
  is now officially within the Overton window. I swear to god if we ever
  find out that this was a lab accident, I am going to dedicate the rest
  of my life to frustrating and antagonizing every journalist, every
  expert, and every politician, that I meet

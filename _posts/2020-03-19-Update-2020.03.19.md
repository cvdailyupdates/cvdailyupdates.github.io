### Official Numbers:

* BNO Newsroom with a [poignant illustration of exponential
  growth](https://twitter.com/BNODesk/status/1240610510065762304?s=09)

* This list is getting unwieldly. Previously I was including all
  countries with at least 100 confirmed infections. Now I'm setting the
  cutoff at 1000. This is purely an aesthetic decision, and I apologize
  to anyone who feels I am unfairly excluding their countries. If it makes
  any difference, I'm pretty sure that basically all of these numbers are
  made up, and so obscured by fog-of-war as to be meaningless. I've wanted
  to discontinue this category for a week now, but I figured that logging
  it for posterity would be useful

* 242,714 confirmed infections
* 9,867 confirmed deaths
* 84,972 confirmed recoveries
* 81,156 China
* 41,035 Italy
* 18,407 Iran
* 17,963 Spain
* 15,320 Germany
* 13,680 US
* 10,886 France
* 8,565 Korea, South
* 4,075 Switzerland
* 2,716 United Kingdom
* 2,465 Netherlands
* 2,013 Austria
* 1,795 Belgium
* 1,746 Norway
* 1,439 Sweden
* 1,225 Denmark

### USA

* [New York

  on their way to be as bad as Italy. If any of you live in NYC, I would
  recommend _**extremely**_ strongly to get the fuck out
* Texas is one step below lockdown, with the mandated closure of most
  public places.
* I keep hearing rumours of national guard mobilizations and nationwide
  forced lockdowns. I mean, I've been hearing these rumours for a week
  already, but today they seem more frequent than usual. Take with a
  grain of salt, but it is what it is
* Gavin Newsom estimates that [56% of the population of California, 25.5 million
  people](https://twitter.com/passantino/status/1240754714213376000),
  will be infected within 8 weeks. This cannot possibly be true. Maybe,
  MAYBE if they did nothing, but they're already locking down. If that
  number was true, and the CFRs we see are anywhere near reality, then
  there'd be the better part of 1 million dead in Wuhan alone.

### Europe

* Netherlands is going to [test a bunch of donated
  blood](https://www.ad.nl/dossier-coronavirus/landelijke-bloedtest-om-te-zien-of-in-nederland-immuniteit-tegen-corona-ontstaat~ae8f611a/)
  for coronavirus antibodies to try and answer once and for all how far
  it's spread in the popuatlion already. Interesting to me because it
  implies that we have an antibody test and the ability to scale it up
  already.
* Italian death toll [officialy higher than
  China's](https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/covid-19-confirmed-cases-latest-news-and-other-developments-in-ottawa).
  Judge for yourself whether you think it actually is

### Asia

* [Unnerving video of the Wuhan
  skyline](https://twitter.com/jenniferatntd/status/1240736835732717571),
  showing a lot fewer lights than I'd expect. Note that I have had a
  weird feeling that this particular twitter account is unreliable,
  although I can't point to any specific reason why

### Science/Medical

* [Discovery of a 382-nt deletion during the early evolution of
  SARS-CoV-2](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.11.987222v1.full.pdf)
  Paper makes the claim that there's been a deletion mutation detected
  in Singapore that dramatically reduces the lethality of this virus.
  Perhaps that explains Singapores surprisingly low numbers?
* [Tracking another
  mutant](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20035204v1),
  with a mutation that the researchers fear is being selected for. They
  don't know what it changes and they advise keeping an eye on it
* Some attempts at estimating the ratio of asymptomatic infections.
  [This one estimates it at
  30%](https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(20\)30139-9/pdf)
  using data on repatriated Japanese citizens from China
* [This paper estimates there to be a massive amount of asymptomatic
  infection](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022434v2).
  It posits that there are 2 million infected in Wuhan, but an infection
  fatality rate of only 0.04%. Unless I've done my math wrong, that
  implies only 800 deaths in Wuhan, which, even China's fake-low numbers
  are higher than that
* [This paper says that severity of symptoms rises dramatically with
  age](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0822-7).
* [The CDC jumps in with actual observed
  data](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6912e2.htm?s_cid=mm6912e2_w).
  Their age bands are weird ("20-44", really?) and their numbers are
  shockingly high (15-20% of that age group got hospitalized). Potential
  confounds are a) that 'hospitalization' doesn't mean what I think it
  means; and b) These are US-confirmed infections and we all know what
  kind of fiasco testing has been. This is likely to heavily bias the
  sample in the 'severe' direction
* [Antibody
  test?!?!?!](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037713v1)
* [Observation that IL-6
  levels](https://twitter.com/chrisvcsefalvay/status/1240647917477773312)
  are much higher in people who die of COVID19. Perhaps this is a useful
  screening tool for predicting who goes severe

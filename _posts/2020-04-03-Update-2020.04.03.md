### Updates

* [New York issues
  order](https://twitter.com/Mac_Cushing/status/1245828041902895106)
  that they're not going to resuscitate cardiac arrest cases, to avoid
  risk of infection to EMTs
* [NYC pandemic
  stats](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).
  Important, this is the first significant data source I have for
  age-related hospitalization rates. 9% hospitalization rate for
  under-44, and death rate 0.5%. These are significantly lower than for
  higher age ranges, but 9% of ending up in a hospital is still much too
  high for my tastes
* [Singapore doesn't have it under control after
  all](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/most-workplaces-to-close-schools-will-move-to-full-home-based-learning-from-next).
  They're doing half a lockdown, apparently
* [More evidence that cats can catch this, although they don't seem to
  be significant infection
  risk](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.021196v1)
* [It makes more sense to treat severe cases as
  hypoxemic](https://rebelem.com/covid-19-hypoxemia-a-better-and-still-safe-way/).
  Old treatment: "lungs don't work". New treatment: "not enough O2 in
  blood". More evidence that something other than lung failure is going on

### 2020.03.12

### Official Numbers:

* Johns Hopkins dashboard is down again, and I am unable to report the
  numbers

### WHO

* [The World Health Organization has announced that dogs cannot contract Covid-19.
  Dogs previously held in quarantine can now be released. To be clear, WHO let the dogs out.](https://twitter.com/DiageoLiam/status/1238021117941596161)

### Asia

* Citizenlab [did a
  study](https://medium.com/pcmag-access/china-has-been-censoring-coronavirus-information-for-months-933205db1b0f)
  documenting how china censors coronavirus content on their social media
  sites

### US:

* [Warning: HIGHLY SPECULATIVE CONSPIRACY THEORIZING, JUDGE ACCORDINGLY]
  [Is Trump infected?](https://youtu.be/O2baYFjrEqg?) Watch his speech
  again last night and focus on the following timestamps: 2:31, 4:36,
  5:51, 7:55
* Coronavirus Clown World: apparently [some school districts in
  WA](https://twitter.com/Ed_Realist/status/1238103434378665986?s=20)
  are not permitted to use disinfectants, because of rules requiring
  environmentally friendly cleaners
* [CDC says some flu deaths were posthumously identified as
  Coronavirus](https://edition.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-03-11-20-intl-hnk/h_1319f66f92245a2fe4ec63fe91ab66c9).
  I don't know why this seems like a scandal or a big deal, as it would be
  foolish to think this wasn't the case
* [Did not watch this, I'm not gonna sit through
  it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB4FUHHMI24) Neil DeGrasse Tyson
  on Colbert's current show. If the commentary I saw is correct, he's
  castigating the public for "not listening to scientists". God this makes
  me mad. For most of February the _**WORLD FUCKING HEALTH ORGANIZATION**_
  was running a disinformation campaign telling everyone that this was no
  big deal and everything is fine. The CDC said this. That's not
  politicians (or at least it's not supposed to be). It's scientists.
  When this started, I contacted every medical professional I know to ask,
  them, off the record, what to do. Every single one gave me "it's just
  the flu, bro". The scientists and medical workers are just as
  responsible as the politicians and leaders for the current public
  complacency and lack of preparedness, and to say otherwise is the
  absolute pinnacle of smug bougie arrogance
* Ohio Health Dept. Director says [1% of Ohioans likely
  infected](https://twitter.com/Tylerjoelb/status/1238178944131760129).
  This number seems unbelievably high to me, because of what it would
  imply: that Ohio hospitals are either already 10x overflowing, or will
  be in a week. That WA/CA/NY are already at 5 or 10%. If her statement
  is true, then I would dramatically _lower_ my estimate of the danger of
  this disease.
* Anecdote: The panic buying has reached my city in force. Across the
  country, lots of grocery stores are getting emptied very fast. One
  contact on Discord, who owns(?) a store of some sort, said it's "worse
  than Black Friday". If this keeps up, I expect looting to start,
  _somewhere_ in the US, in a week or two. Stay safe everyone

### Science/Medical

* [Facebook post from a Seattle-area
  doctor](https://i.redd.it/5a9admitw6m41.png). I don't know what to
  make of this but a lot of that sounds very alarming.
* A writeup of current knowledge of the virus.
  [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com/view.aspx?resid=16A92D57208258EE!4375&ithint=file%2cdocx&authkey=!ADUCZrsWHwEJ9To),
  [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/uqwrHiPL). I cannot vouch for the
  reliability of this post. I don't even remember where I found it
  (probably reddit), it was just in one of my tabs at the end of the day.

### Markets

* We're fucked. The Dow has fallen a hair under 28% in the past 30 days.
  The market is chaotic and unstable right now and I'm not going to draw
  and strong long term conclusions from it, but I think we're seeing the
  consequences of everyone realizing how fucked our supply chains are.

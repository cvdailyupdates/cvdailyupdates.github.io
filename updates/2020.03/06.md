### Official Numbers:

* [The total number of confirmed infected has exceeded 100,000
  worldwide](https://twitter.com/bnodesk/status/1235886017674125314?s=21).
  Remember, doubling period is approximately a week. By the first week
  of April we'll have 1M _official_ infections. Now keep in mind that the
  official numbers are off by a factor of 10 at least

### Website and Links:

### Middle East:

* [Somebody's personal
  story](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/febz3f/my_experience_of_living_in_a_city_without/)
  about Tehran. He claims it is not as bad as I have been lead to believe

### China:

### Asia:

* [Korea has tested 140,000
  people](https://www.yahoo.com/news/south-korea-tested-140-000-031000719.html).
  They're reporting a current death rate of 0.6%. Does this mean that
  there is a massive long tail of mild/asymptomatic infection? I think
  it's too soon to tell, but we can hope

### Europe:

### UK:

* NHS considering [drafting med
  students](https://www.hsj.co.uk/acute-care/medical-students-and-new-doctors-could-be-drafted-in-to-fight-coronavirus/7027060.article)
  to augment medical workforce. This is sufficiently serious that I
  won't share my usual opinion on the subject of socialized medicine.

### US:

* [Healthcare Information and Management Systems
  Society](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/tech/himss-cancels-2020-global-health-conference-due-to-coronavirus)
  global health conference cancelled

### Canada:

### Tech:

* [Two Microsoft
  employees](https://twitter.com/KYWeise/status/1235799066279178242)
  confirmed infected

### Science/Medical:

* [German researchers identify
  protease](https://www.rnd.de/gesundheit/coronavirus-mogliches-medikament-von-forschern-identifiziert-FZXKQDXB2ZAGXHQR7U3LBKFNOM.html)
  that seems to prevent coronavirus infections
* [Story of Australian couple who got
  infected](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-05/coronavirus-covid-19-what-its-like-to-have-the-virus/12026902)
  on a cruise. Two interesting things. First, woman is testing positive
  again after recovery. Second: the man tested positive but never showed
  symptoms. Overall I think this is good news
* [Preliminary safety trials for vaccine
  candidate](https://www.livescience.com/us-coronavirus-vaccine-trial-recruiting.html).
  Good news, but do not be fooled: the BEST case is that we're one year
  out on a vaccine
* [Some virologists
  demanding](http://virological.org/t/response-to-on-the-origin-and-continuing-evolution-of-sars-cov-2/418)
  that the "S-type and L-type" paper be retracted

### Market:

* [Lufthansa cuts 150 planes' worth of
  capacity](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lufthansa-coronavirus-exclusive-idUSKBN20R229).
  I've seen reports of other airlines doing similar

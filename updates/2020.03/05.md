* If you think there are any errors on this site, open a pull request to
  correct it. If you think there is any content I should include, please
  open an issue. You can do both of these things at [the Github
repo](https://github.com/cvdailyupdates/cvdailyupdates.github.io)
* I don't want to add any Javascript to this site, but it would be nice
  if I could make these sections collapsible. There is a `<details>`
  HTML5 tag that would work, but I can't figure out how to make it play
  nice with Jekyll. If anyone knows how to do this, please contact me

### Personal

### Iran:

### India

### Korea:

### Italy:

### China:

* A patient who was discharged as recovered [has
  died](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3065091/coronavirus-recovered-patient-dies-china-reports-139-new-cases).
  This may be evidence that reinfection is occurring, however I still
  believe it's inconsistent testing. There are rumours that China is
  discharging patients who have not yet fully recovered, in order to make
  numbers look better. If, as the one recent article said, 14% of
  'recovered' patients are getting sick again, I'd expect a lot more than
  _one_ death

### Singapore:

### Asia:

* Thailand to [start disinfecting mail
  packages](https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/1872344/thailand-begins-disinfecting-packages).
  I don't know if this is necessary or not, but you might consider
  spraying down amazon boxes with lysol before picking them up

### WHO:

### Europe:

* French police are [threatening to invoke their right](https://twitter.com/Deven_Intel/status/1235571307112214528)
  not to enforce the law if the French government does not supply them appropriate PPE by March 9th

### Israel:

### US:

* [Coronavirus Testing designated an 'essential health
  benefit'](https://twitter.com/francoordonez/status/1235276782477205504?s=21),
  which means that insurers, medicare, and medicaid _must_ cover it. I
  am still skeptical that anyone is getting tested at all
* [CDC started reporting state level infected counts
  again](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html).
  Reminder that these numbers are off by at least a factor of ten, due to
  lack of testing
* [Apple pulls
  out](https://appleosophy.com/2020/03/04/apple-gets-out-of-sxsw-due-to-coronavirus/)
  of SXSW. Please, please, please, let enough people pull out that they
  cancel it.
* [Medical Screener at
  LAX](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/medical-screener-lax-airport-tests-positive-coronavirus-n1149986)
  tests positive for Coronavirus. Normally I wouldn't report something
  like this ("oooh another person got infected" WE KNOW) but this is a
  useful pretense to highlight: CANCEL ALL YOUR TRAVEL PLANS. Travelling
  by air puts you in close contact with a lot of people and you have no
  way of knowing if they're sick or not. It is likely that this disease
  will be spread far and wide by the very same people tasked with stopping
  it (since they come into the most contact with infected) so the easiest
  way to stay safe is to avoid those people. Your trip can wait.
* Port of Seattle [before and after
  pictures](https://imgur.com/a/yCC9ASZ/). International shipping is
  fucked and our economy is going to get super fucked real soon

### Canada:

* Canadian military expecting [25% absentee
  rate](https://globalnews.ca/news/6631960/coronavirus-canadian-military-pandemic-planning/).
  At least they're planning for it
* Two Canadian insurance companies [stop covering Coronavirus-related trip cancellations](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/coronavirus-manulife-tugo-travel-insurance-1.5486117).
  I understand why they'd do this but this is bad, it's going to encourage
  more people to not cancel trips. DO NOT BOOK ANY TRIPS FOR THE NEAR
  FUTURE

### Tech:

* [RUMINT](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=rumint):
  Linkedin California offices closed, mandatory WFH. I can't confirm
  this in actual news yet, but I trust the source.
* Microsoft HQ in Redmond [tells employees to work from
  home](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/fdo74s/microsoft_hq_asking_all_employees_to_work_from/).
  I'm working on confirming if this was a suggestion or an order

### Science/Medical:

* [Research paper from 13 years
  ago](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/208354) about
  nonpharmaceutical interventions during the [Spanish Flu
  epidemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu_epidemic). TL;DR:
  The faster that schools and public places were closed, the fewer people
  died. _**CALL YOUR LOCAL POLITICIANS AND TELL THEM TO SHUT DOWN EVERYTHING**_
* Australian National University [did some pandemic
  modelling](https://anu.prezly.com/coronavirus-is-highly-uncertain-and-the-costs-could-be-high).
  It's not looking good. In the best-case pandemic scenario, they get
  15 million worldwide deaths. In the worst-case scenario, 68 million.

* Dr. Campbell's video today [explained the S-CoV & L-CoV dual
  strains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYPZHA-UjUY) I posted about
  yesterday

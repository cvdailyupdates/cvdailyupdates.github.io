### 2020.03.04

### Official Numbers:

### Personal:

* Most recent known exposure to someone who was visibly sick: 2020.02.25

### Iran:

* [Iran has mobilized the
  army](https://globalnews.ca/news/6622645/iran-coronavirus-death-toll-army/) to deal with the plague

### India

* [India is rapidly gaining
  cases](https://twitter.com/WarsontheBrink/status/1235064476870651906?s=20). I'm honestly surprised they went this long without finding any. Given what I've heard of the state of public sanitation in India, this could be _very_ bad

### Korea:

### Italy:

### China:

### Singapore:

### WHO:

### US:

* [Pence claims we can start testing in force next
  week](https://twitter.com/katierogers/status/1234977487190290432?s=21) given all the rumours we see about tests being denied and tests not working, I'm pressing X to doubt this.
* [No audio or video was allowed at the most recent Coronavirus
  briefing](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/fd496w/white_house_does_not_allow_video_or_audio/). This is extremely ominous
* Bay area spread increases with [first case confirmed in Berkeley](https://www.berkeleyside.com/2020/03/03/city-of-berkeley-reports-first-coronavirus-patient). I have friends who live there, I hope they will be ok.
* Emerald City Comic Con in Seattle is still on next week.
* [Continued
  reports](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUS/comments/fd6f8c/my_friend_and_his_wife_and_kid_just_came_through/) that screening in US airports is non-existant.

### Texas:

### Tech:

* [Amazon employee in Seattle office confirmed
  infected](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/amazon/amazon-employee-in-seattle-has-tested-positive-for-illness-caused-by-coronavirus/). I expect other tech companies to respond to this with aggressive, urgent measures.
* [Indeed has mandated work-from-home for all employees
  worldwide](https://www.kxan.com/news/local/austin/indeed-asks-all-employees-to-work-from-home-halt-business-travel-due-to-coronavirus/). No employees are confirmed infected at this time.

### Science:

* [Potential successful anti-viral medical
treatment](https://www.theolivepress.es/spain-news/2020/03/02/hiv-drug-successfully-treats-coronavirus-patient-in-medical-first-in-spains-andalucia/)
* Relapse news: the British couple that vlogged from the Diamond Princess [have started testing positive again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGHjq3FPHEE). They don't sound particularly sick to me. Keep an eye on them. If they get sick again, that is very bad news.

Apologies. I will try to be better about posting sources tomorrow, but I
didn't keep track of them when I wrote this

### 2020.03.03

### Official Numbers:

* 92,861 Confirmed Infected
* 3,162 Confirmed Deaths
* 48,272 Confirmed Recoveries
* 80,151 infected in Mainland China (I personally believe the real
  number is at least 10x this)
* 5,186 infected in South Korea
* 2,502 infected in Italy
* 2,336 infected in Iran (I personally believe the real number is at
  least 10x this)
* 293 infected in Japan
* 204 infected in France
* 196 infected in Germany
* 122 infected in US (I personally believe the real number is at least
  5x this)
* 110 infected in Singapore

### Personal:

* I have transitioned to full time work-from-home
* Temp 98, SPO2 99%
* Most recent exposure to someone who was visibly sick: 2020.02.25

### Iran:

* Still really really bad. Highest end of death count estimates is 3000ish total. [8% of their governing MPs are infected.](https://edition.cnn.com/asia/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-03-03-20-intl-hnk/h_13306122baecfcaa123a7ca59478d0d6)
* Apparently municipal water pressure is down. This implies a lot of people are washing their hands a lot. It also implies they're not dead, which is reassuring
* Releasing prisoners from prisons to avoid prison spread. This is presumed to represent a general loss of state-governing capacity.

### Korea:

* "State of war" declared (I believe this is rhetorical not formal)
* ~5000 documented cases

### Italy:

* Death rate significantly higher than chinese numbers, WHO numbers, korean numbers, singaporean numbers. Unclear if real or sampling bias
* Getting ready to (already started?) full on no-in-no-out cordon sanitaire around epicenter towns

### China:

* Not a lot of media coming out of China lately, leaks or otherwise
* Official numbers suggest China actually does have this under control. WHO confirms this
* At this time, I provisionally believe this, if for no other reason than that their draconian quarantines must have worked

### Singapore:

* _Appears_ to have it more-or-less contained.
* Does this lend evidence to 'hotter weather will save us'? I hope so

### WHO:

* WHO formally announced [fatality rate of
3.5%](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1234872254883909642)
* WHO formally announced that [this is worse than the
flu](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1234872254883909642)

### US:

* Our authorities are still so incompetent it looks like malice
* 9 are now dead, 8 in King County (Seattle), 1 in Snohomish County (Seattle Suburb). The official count of US patients is 102
* [Georgia confirmed 2
  infected](https://twitter.com/BNODesk/status/1234675316380954624)
* [North Carolina confirmed an
  infected](https://twitter.com/BNODesk/status/1234939044359962625)
* Testing kits are still not being made available. Presumably they still don't work.
* [Some epidemiologist(?) went on CBS news](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-infection-outbreak-worldwide-virus-expert-warning-today-2020-03-02/) to give a coronavirus primer and while he downplayed it he did say at one point that in all likelihood millions of Americans will die from this
* [Man wearing mask apparently collapses on sidewalk in New York](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-infection-outbreak-worldwide-virus-expert-warning-today-2020-03-02/). OH GOD I HOPE THIS ISN'T REAL

### Texas:

* [San Antonio lost their lawsuit](https://www.ksat.com/news/local/2020/03/03/judge-denies-san-antonios-court-filing-to-prevent-release-of-coronavirus-evacuees/) suing the federal government to prevent them from releasing all their quarantined people from the airforce base
* [San Antonio declared state of emergency](https://www.expressnews.com/news/local/article/San-Antonio-to-feds-Keep-coronavirus-evacuees-in-15098761.php). I think this lets them use emergency powers to override the legal ruling
* Rumours of infection at Houston hospital
* [At least one person awaiting test results in
  Austin](https://www.statesman.com/news/20200303/travis-county-testing-at-least-one-person-for-new-coronavirus).
Knowing nothing about the case other than that they are waiting for test
results, I would assume that they are infected
* SXSW is still not cancelled
* [The following have pulled out of
  SXSW](https://www.austin360.com/entertainment/20200303/sxsw-2020-and-coronavirus-herersquos-whos-not-coming):
Facebook, Jack Dorsey, Intel, Vevo, Mashable, TikTok, Tim Ferris

### Tech:

* My employer continues to make aggressive WFH preparations while
  denying any explicit WFH plans at this time. I am inclined to believe
  them. Overall not super impressed with their response but it has been
  acceptable
* [Google staged a WFH "drill" in Dublin today.](https://www.businessinsider.com/google-dublin-coronavirus-work-from-home-twitter-coinbase-2020-3) They are extending the drill to tomorrow. Assumption is that it's not a drill
* [Google "cancels in-person attendance" at Google IO](https://twitter.com/BNODesk/status/1234943293299056640?s=09). This is a very big tech conference, if google's doing this it's serious
* [Coinbase internal preparedness document leaked](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SRP4dnVCvKB7A5WXrESe-cL51i6_cg5nNGLNld6qch0/preview#). It is shockingly reasonable. If other tech companies have similar internal documents, that is reassuring

### Science:

* Prevotella rumours remain unaddressed (tldr [virus somehow binds to a common gut bacteria and this helps spread it undetectibly](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339008515_The_2019_Wuhan_outbreak_is_caused_by_the_bacteria_Prevotella_which_is_aided_by_the_coronavirus_possibly_to_adhere_to_epithelial_cells_-_Prevotella_is_present_in_huge_amounts_in_patients_from_both_Chin)). I am not a biologist and have no ability to judge whether this is plausible or insane
* Small children are starting to test positive but still do not ever show symptoms. [Some experts wondering if this spreads undetected via kids as carriers](https://twitter.com/DrJeanneM/status/1234838382661910528)
* People continue to test positive several weeks after being declared recovered. I am not yet aware of any case where this happens and the 'recovered' person gets sick again. My current belief is that this is bad tests
* Chinese doctors hypothesize unreliability of tests due to checking for _lower_ respiratory tract virus via _upper_ respiratory tract swabs

### Market:

* The federal reserve cut interest rates by 0.5 percentage points
* This should have made the market go up
* The market did not go up. RIP my retirement

### Politics:

* Possibility that Boris Johnson has been exposed to infection (Shook hands with people in a coronavirus hospital for PR like a fucking idiot)
* Possibility that Benjamin Netanyahu has been exposed to infection (extended close contact with a general that is currently in quarantine coming back from asia. Forget if general is diagnosed or not)
* Possibility that Mike Pence has been exposed to infection ([Shook hands with a school student](https://twitter.com/jenniferjjacobs/status/1234822447947558915?s=21) whose classmate has since been quarantined
* Vatican formally states that [Pope had coronavirus test that came back negative](https://www.foxnews.com/world/pope-francis-tests-negative-for-coronavirus-after-catching-cold-report). I am not sure I believe them. Even if true that he tested negative, I'm not sure it matters; the tests are very unreliable

### Predictions:

* My city will have its first confirmed case in a matter of days. I assume that we will see an explosion of identified cases a few days after that, as we did in Washington state, but this depends on whether or not test kits are made available
* At least one tech company will go 100% mandatory work from home in at least one US city by the end of next week
* Some level of lockdown will be implemented in some location (likely WA) in the US by the end of next week (50% confidence) or by the end of the month (95% confidence)
* Some level of widespread lockdown that personally impacts me will be implemented by the end of the month (60% confidence)

### Prescriptions:

* It may be time to put "do not go out into public for any reason at all unless your life depends on it" plans into action within the next 2-3 weeks

### Misc:

* Currently there are questions regarding how many people who get this disease and are asymptomatic. We do not have good data on this
* Going by WHO report, the answer is 0%: "Asymptomatic infection has been reported, but the majority of the relatively rare cases who are asymptomatic on the date of identification/report went on to develop disease. The proportion of truly asymptomatic infections is unclear but appears to be relatively rare and does not appear to be a major driver of transmission."
* Going by what apparently happened on the Diamond Princess, assuming that everyone on board got infected, the answer is 60% are asymptomatic (I'm eyeballing it, looks like about 1/3rd of the passengers got sick?)
* Going by the weird cult church in Korea, about 40% of people who are confirmed positive by test show no symptoms

### Oval Office speech

Today at 9pm EST, President Trump gave a speech from the oval office.
The important points:

* Thirty day travel ban on Europe
* The UK is exempt from this
* All coronavirus-related medical costs to be covered in full by
  insurers
* "The risk is very very low" this is a bold-faced lie
* "young and healthy people can expect to recover very very quickly"
  this is also a lie
* Financial relief will be given to workers who have to self-quarantine
* "This is not a financial crisis, just a temporary obstacle" this is a
  lie
* SBA will provide low-interest loans to impacted small businesses
* Some kind of penalty-free delay on tax payments, I didn't get the
  details
* Payroll tax relief is being proposed to congress

Overall, I don't know what to make of this, but I don't like it. The
content of the speech seems grossly out of line with the level of
gravitas around it. This is a great crisis... which is why I'm getting
the government to give people loans. And they can pay their taxes late
if they want.

I don't know. Maybe my estimates and expectations are unrealistically
pessimistic. Or maybe the government thinks that "only" one million
lives isn't that much of a price to pay (note: I expect on the order of
10x that many deaths before this is done). I was expecting him to
announce some level of enforced quarantine or lockdown here.

  are working with the feds to start testing again but I don't have the
  link handy

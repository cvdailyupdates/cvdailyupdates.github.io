### Good Sources

I have no affiliation with any of these links. They are my personal
recommendations

[Dr John Campbell, NHS medical
instructor](https://www.youtube.com/user/Campbellteaching)

[Practical tips to protect yourself in an
epidemic](http://beatthecoronavirus.com/)

[In-Depth Prepping Guide](https://theprepared.com/wuhan-coronavirus/)

[Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf). This should be considered the most official source of truth about this crisis at this time.

[Johns Hopkins Crisis
Dashboard](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6)

[Worldometer Coronavirus Page](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). At-a-glance numbers and summaries

[BNO Newsroom
Twitter](https://twitter.com/BNODesk?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)
possibly the single best journalistic source to follow

[Broadcastify](https://www.broadcastify.com/). Listen in to police, fire, and EMS radios. Might be useful for primary-source information

[Singapore Government Coronavirus
Dashboard](https://co.vid19.sg/dashboard). Singapore has had seemingly
the best response to this crisis so far, and has kept the disease
numbers low as a result. I consider this the gold standard in terms of
reliability. I trust this data even more than I trust the WHO data, even
though the WHO data is more "official"
